     Maybe you really truly dont care if malicious software attacks your computer or enlists it in a Distributed Denial of Service attack Ill just wipe it if I have to you say But its not just about you A recent study showed a kind of herd immunity effect In countries where a higher percentage of the population used antivirus even the unprotected ones fared better So be a good citizen and do your part If you dont want to pay for a premium antivirus utility pick one of the free antivirus products that weve rounded up for you  

     Quite a few of these products are free only for noncommercial use if you want to protect your business you have to pony up for the paid edition At that point you should probably consider upgrading to a full security suite After all its your businesss security on the line And if youve grown beyond SMB status investing in a SaaS endpoint protection system will let you monitor and manage security across your entire organization  

     Yes its true that Windows 8 and Windows 10 have antivirus built right in but in our tests and most independent lab tests Windows Defender hasnt done very well There have been some signs of improvement in recent tests which is encouraging  

     Your antivirus should definitely have the ability to root out existing malware but its ongoing task is to prevent ransomware botnets Trojans and other types of nasty programs from getting a foothold All of the antivirus programs in this collection offer realtime protection against malware attack Some take the fight upstream working hard to ensure you never even browse to a malwarehosting site or get fooled into turning over your credentials to a phishing site  

     Independent Antivirus Lab Test Results Around the world researchers at independent antivirus testing labs spend their days putting antivirus tools to the test Some of these labs regularly release public reports on their findings I follow six such labs closely AVComparatives AVTest Institute Dennis Technology Labs ICSA Labs Virus Bulletin and West Coast Labs  

     Security companies typically pay for the privilege of being included in testing In return the labs supply them with detailed reports that can help improve their products The number of labs that include a particular vendor serves as a measure of significance In each case the lab considered the product important enough to test and the vendor felt the price was worthwhile The labs dont necessarily test a vendors free product but most vendors pack full protection into the free product enhancing premium versions with additional features Ive worked out a system for aggregating lab results yielding a lab score from 0 to 5 or NA if there just isnt enough data  

     Since I use the same samples month after month the malwareblocking test definitely doesnt measure a products ability to detect brandnew threats In a separate test I attempt to download malware from 100 very new malicious URLs supplied by MRGEffitas typically less than a day old I note whether the antivirus blocked all access to the URL wiped out the malicious payload during download or did nothing McAfee and Symantec both paid products hold the very best scores in this test though some free antivirus utilities have done fairly well  

     Useful Features Just about every antivirus product scans files on access to make sure malware cant launch and also scans the entire system on demand or on a schedule you set The one exception in the current collection is a tool aimed very specifically at detecting attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system or applications That tool Malwarebytes AntiExploit Free is designed for use in conjunction with a regular antivirus  

     Blocking all access to malwarehosting URLs is a nice way to avoid trouble Many products extend that protection to also steer users away from fraudulent websites phishing sites that try to steal login credentials for financial sites and other sensitive sites A few rate links in search results flagging any dangerous or iffy ones  

     Behaviorbased detection a feature of some antivirus products is a twoedged sword On the one hand it can detect malware thats never been seen before On the other hand if its not done right it can baffle the user with messages about perfectly legitimate programs  

     One easy way to keep your PC protected is to install all security updates both for Windows and for browsers and other popular applications Starting with Windows 10 Windows updates arent optional for consumers but there are plenty of security holes in popular apps and addons Scanning for vulnerabilities in the form of missing updates is a feature most often found in commercial antivirus products but it does turn up in some free ones In the chart above you can see which products include these useful features  

     Whats Not Here This article reports only on free antivirus products that received at least a good rating in our reviewsthree stars or better Among those that didnt make the cut is Microsoft Security Essentials  Windows Defender All of the independent labs I follow do include Microsoft in testing but most use it as a baseline If a product cant do better than the baseline its got real problems There may be hope though In the latest report from AVTest Microsoft earned a decent 14 of 18 possible points much better than its previous failing grade of 95 points And Dennis Labs awarded Microsoft AAA certification its highest rating  

     There are also numerous free antivirus utilities that work solely to clean up existing malware infestations You bring out these cleanuponly tools when you have a nasty malware infestation When the problems gone they have no further use since they offer no ongoing protection Our Editors Choice in this category is Malwarebytes AntiMalware 20 and its definitely one you should try if youve got a malware problem But since theyre free you can keep trying others if the first one doesnt do the job When the scare is over youll need a fullblown antivirus for ongoing protection  

     Whats Best Our current Editors Choice products for free antivirus utility are Avast Free Antivirus AVG AntiVirus Free and Panda Free Antivirus All three get very good scores from the independent labs and in our own tests as well All three include some useful bonus features Avast in particular packs a password manager and a network security scanner in its toolkit If you do have a little cash in your budget for security the best paid antivirus products do tend to offer more and better protection If not try a few of these free tools and see which one you like best  

    For Windows PC users a good antivirus program is a necessity to ward off malware attacks keep your computer running efficiently and safeguard your online identity and personal information Premium antivirus suites have additional features to protect you from malicious Web pages help you manage security on mobile devices and monitor your computers firewall software updates and other features But some just dont want to  or cant  pay a yearly subscription fee for those extra features  

    So which free PC antivirus product is right for you We reviewed Avira Free Antivirus Malwarebytes AntiMalware Free Avast Free Antivirus AVG Antivirus Free and Microsoft Windows Defender Each was tested on the same Windows 8 Acer Aspire E1 laptop which featured a Core i3 processor and 4 GB of RAM 

Our malwaredetection data comes primarily from independent German evaluation lab AVTEST which regularly tests all major security software for the ability to detect zeroday malware and other threats     We also conducted our own tests on how each security suite affected a laptops performance running the PCMark7 benchmark software and our own OpenOffice productivity test to assess the systems baseline We ran the tests again while each security product did a quick malware scan and then again during full system scans and compared the results  

    Ease of use is also important which is why we assessed each program on its user interface and also on how insistently it nags you to upgrade from the free version to a paid edition from the same company 

     Editors choice Avira Free Antivirus Best Free Overall PC Antivirus 810 Totally worth it Review Download Now According to AVTEST Avira offers the strongest protection against both widespread and zeroday malware Its austere interface can be intimidating at first and computers with less RAM might see a performance impact However Avira Free Antivirus sheer effectiveness and good range of features  including a mobile portal and childsafety settings  make it the best choice

     Avast Free Antivirus Best Free PC Antivirus User Interface 710 Very good Review Download Now We liked Avast Free Antivirus for its friendly interface good performance and unique if relatively sophisticated set of features Its a good dependable program but it just wasnt the best in this roundup either in terms of antivirus protection or extra features However you may want to consider Avast Free Antivirus if you already use other Avast products such as Avast Free Mobile Security for Android our top choice in that category  

    We liked Avast Free Antivirus for its friendly interface good performance and unique if relatively sophisticated set of features Its a good dependable program but it just wasnt the best in this roundup either in terms of antivirus protection or extra features However you may want to consider Avast Free Antivirus if you already use other Avast products such as Avast Free Mobile Security for Android our top choice in that category  

     A better interface This years version gets a row of icons at the top with intuitive images and labels which animate when you hover over them to help you see that youve selected them Clicking each icon drops down a submenu so you can browse all of them before making a move If you get lost just click the home icon thats always in the upper left to return you to the main menu  

     Lots of optional settings Overall you have a fine degree of control over how Avast behaves Clicking the gear icon on the far right takes you to Avast Free Antiviruss settings window which has categories in the lefthand pane and options for each category on the right Clicking Active Protection shows you a submenu that breaks down file protection email protection and browser protection into three subcategories Each of the three has a toggle to disable the whole element which is handy when you already have other software installed that you prefer for one of those three roles Click Customize to drill down into another set of categories and options specific to that role  

     Free syncing password manager Tools bundled with antimalware suites range widely in utility and quality and the free suites rarely include a password manager However the one in Avast is pretty respectable It provides extensions for Firefox and Chrome which you can use to autofill your login information at websites You create a master password that protects your list of individual site passwords and you can also sync your list across devices This requires you to create an account but its free You can also import passwords stored by your browser Avast doesnt make it clear if its list is encrypted and the password manager doesnt have many settings to customize its behavior but if you dont have a password manager this is a decent entry point  

     To sync with Android and iOS devices you need a different app named Avast Passwords available for free at the Google Play store and iTunes App Store The Android version of Avasts security software doesnt bundle the manager and there is no iOS version of Avast Mobile Security You can also subscribe to a premium version of the password manager that lets you transmit your login info from your mobile device to your computer if they are on the same WiFi network by tapping a button on your screen This feature costs a modest 10 a year  

     Streamlined system software updater Avast Free Antivirus can quickly scan your computer for outdated software and updating is integrated into the apps interface It creates a list of programs that need to be updated and you need only click the button next to the programs name to get the latest version Avast noticed that Java was outofdate on our device a problem that can create serious security holes Because of Avast Free Antiviruss update integration we didnt have to go to the Java website and hunt down the correct pages and links This might not be important for advanced users but it also wont get in their way because the update scan is optional and doesnt hound you to use it  

     VPN service overstates its abilities When you log in to the sevenday VPN trial Avast Free Antivirus tells you Your Internet activity is now completely invisible so nobody can spy on you but that isnt necessarily true Your Internet service provider can still detect that youre connecting to a VPN and someone can monitor the VPNs exit point back onto the public Internet and keep logs of that activity And a VPN doesnt necessarily protect you when you transmit personally identifiable information while using it nor does it protect you from malware that may already be on your computer recording what you type or which websites you access  

     According to AVTest and AVComparatives Avasts antivirus engine is relatively fast and accurate without bogging your system down making it one of the best free antivirus apps around And the password manager has cloud syncing across Windows iOS and Android devices a feature that the other managers would usually make you pay for But it would be better if the free and premium components were more clearly distinguished  

 December 28 2015  By BigBadWolf_2009  20151228 082145  By BigBadWolf_2009     Ive been using Avast exclusively for the past 5 or 6 years and have never had a problem  it runs all the time and if you go to open a site or an attachment that isnt safe it will pop up and warn you  this is an unbelievable service for Free 

    Ive been an Avast fan for years  and Ive used it on everything from XPs  to Vistas  and its on both my current WIndows 10s  I even have it on my Android tablet 
Truly its the best product out there  before Avast I used a few of the other top free brands but they never protected me like Avast does  just set it and forget it  if you go to a bad spot it will let you know 
I run scans a few times a week and Avast has kept me clean  it even has scans to catch browser add ons and one for security  this is a rock solid 5 Star program 
Get it youll love it

Was this review helpful 0 0  December 22 2015  By Alex Schwab  20151222 190606  By Alex Schwab     After buying a new computer I attempted to transfer the license over and the software wouldnt let me I purchased the package for 3 computers I called Avasts helpline and told them what was going on and they sent me another copy of my license it still didnt work After that I called them and the phone line was disconnected I emailed them again two days later and still havent received a response 

    I sent a ticket after the first attempt didnt work and never got a response I waited two days and tried calling their number but IT WAS CHANGED I tried another number but it required some passcode or something that I didnt have I looked for another number but didnt have any luck So I sent another ticket I didnt receive a response for this ticket either I also told them in the second ticket that I would like a refund for the VPN service because it slowed my internet down to around 110 of its usual strength from 100Mbps down to 812 Mbps sometimes a little more but there was a very noticeable difference All Im saying is that I think Avast is going downhill with their customer service and I will not be buyingrecommending their products I also have a feeling a lot more people will have the same experience as me due to the changing of phone numbers and lack of response from multiple tickets I was cheated out of a lot of money because I now only have the Avast Free Version 

Was this review helpful 0 0     So if you no longer want to pay for the privilege of protecting your valuable piece of hardware read on  weve picked out four of the best free antivirus engines two top Android apps and two online detection services all delivering great security at no cost 

    If youre looking for a standalone antivirus package then 360 Total Security might seem a little overweight It provides antiphishing support online shopping protection network threat blocking hard drive cleanup tools a Windows update checker and more 

    Still what makes the suite interesting is that it uses no less than five antivirus engines Install it and you can be protected by Bitdefender technology an excellent commercial engine Avira probably the best of the free offerings and three further engines of Qihoos own 

    We found the multiengine approach can affect performance too with 360 Total Security taking anything up to twice as long to scan our system as some of the competition as well as returning more false positives 

    360 Total Security is far from perfect and if youre looking for a simple antivirus engine to run alongside other security tools then itll probably be too much But if detection rates are your top priority then the package is a real contender 

    While free antivirus software wont cost you anything to download you might sometimes find youll pay in other ways Install Avast Free Antivirus and itll also equip your PC with Google toolbar unless youre paying attention and clear the relevant checkbox 

    Scan your system for malware and by default Avast Free Antivirus also checks for junk files unnecessary apps and other performance issues although it wont fix any of these unless you buy the companys PC Optimizer 

    Fortunately you dont have to live with this Avast Free Antivirus has an excellent interface  its clean clear and configurable  and in just a few clicks you can set it up to avoid the timewasting performance scan 

    Some security companies spend a great deal of time and effort on interface design but Avira isnt quite so concerned Sure Avira Free Antivirus adds a graphical launcher to your system tray but the core program looks plain ordinary and a little dated 

    The program is loved by the testing labs Whether you check out AVTest AVComparatives or VB100 reports Avira technology almost always scores very highly And thats not only in relation to free software AVComparatives July 2015 RealWorld Protection Test ranked the program fourth out of 20 mostly commercial contenders with its 997 protection rate comparable with the highlyrated Bitdefender 998 and Kaspersky 997 Thats a typical score not a fluke  sometimes Avira tops the list 

    If youre looking for an easy life then you can leave the program alone and itll do its work almost entirely automatically But expert users get plenty of fine control  there are options to protect the Hosts file block autorun scan archives monitor network drives set the file types to be scanned even password protect your Avira installation so others cant mess with your settings 

    Avira Free Antivirus has a distinct shortage of bonus extras which might be an issue for some The Firewall options add little they configure the standard Windows firewall rather than adding anything new and even basic web protection requires a separate browser extension 

    Still for us Aviras strippedback design is a plus as it makes it easier to add other security tools without conflicts Factor in its many configuration options and Avira is a smart choice for more experienced users 

    Theres no doubt about its accuracy either AVComparatives monthly RealWorld Protection Test has seen Panda in the top two for months now trampling all over the commercial competition And independent testing shows it manages this while raising very few false alarms 

    Bonus extras include USB Protection to keep your USB keys safe from some malware while Process Monitor is a Task Managerlike tool displaying running processes their open HTTP connections and highlighting likely dangers 

    If youre feeling picky and spend long enough exploring the program you might find one or two minor issues Scanning speeds were marginally below average in our tests for instance and the program isnt as configurable as some of the competition 

    Its hard to complain about a package which gives you marketleading protection at zero cost though If youre looking for something simple and reliable which you can install and just leave to do its job then Panda Free Antivirus is a great choice 

    Selecting the best free Android antivirus app is difficult at the moment Its a very competitive market and the independent testing labs consistently show theres very little between the leading products 

    Avira Antivirus Security earns our vote for its consistency Its a reliable engine typically amongst the toprated apps at AVTest and AV Comparatives and its 44 star rated at Google Play and Aviras excellent record with PC security software makes us think youll be able to trust the product over the long term 

    There are plenty of bonus features too Antitheft tools can locate a lost phone trigger a siren or remotely lock or wipe a device and privacy ratings give you an indication of how apps are handling your data plus you also get identity protection app locking call filtering and more 

    Browsing protection hourly updates and tech support are reserved for the commercial Pro version only but Avira Antivirus Security provides the core essentials you need and does a great job of keeping you safe 

    360 Security  Antivirus FREE is one of the most popular antivirus apps around and the name alone gives you one reason why it really is free Okay you get ads but there are no upgrade buttons or limitations to the protection you get 

    Were particularly interested in the antivirus and 360 Security  Antivirus FREE delivers there too Its an extremely accurate engine which doesnt generate too much traffic significantly drain the battery or otherwise get in the way of your regular activities 

Installing a good antivirus engine will keep you safe from most threats but no product offers a 100 detection guarantee Even if a download hasnt raised an alert you might sometimes wonder if its safe    Upload a suspect file to VirusTotal and within seconds youll see the scanning results from 56 leading antivirus packages along with an indepth analysis of the file and even what it does when run on your computer the modules it needs the files it reads and writes and more 

    One problem with this multiproduct approach is youll regularly see false positives where most of the engines say a file is safe but a few flag it as dangerous If only a small number of packages raise alerts maybe five or less and the most trusted engines say its safe we might run the file anyway  but that does increase your risk of infection Wait a day or two and try scanning the file again if youre concerned 

    MetaScan Online uses fewer engines than VirusTotal  43 as opposed to 56  but thats not necessarily a bad thing Dropping the weaker products should mean fewer false positives and we also found reports were generated far more quickly 

    MetaScan Online can also scan marginally larger files than VirusTotal 140MB compared to 128MB and has a neat Scan History page to show how a files detection rate has changed over time But balancing that it doesnt provide any behavioural information and malware doesnt normally arrive in such large files anyway 

    The 15 best free and paid antivirus programs for your PC or laptop in the UK in 20152016 Best Antivirus reviews tests and ratings Where to buy antivirus Best Windows antivirus for PC and laptop See also best security software programs of 20152016 

    If youve just downloaded Windows 10 or bought a new Windows 10 PC dont forget that it will need some help to keep it working as well as it does right now And that means installing security software Here we round up the best free antivirus and best paid antivirus for Windows 10 plus older Windows operating systems running on your PC or laptop See also best business antivirus 20152016 UK 

    Antivirus software detects and then prevents disarms or removes malicious programs or malware often referred to as viruses Antivirus doesnt offer a perfect solution to the problem of malware but it is a critical first step to securing your PC or laptop To help prevent viruses infecting your PC you must install antivirus and then regularly update your antivirus software All of the antivirus software reviewed here will update automatically 

    In recent years the technology that powers AV software has changed dramatically An AV package you purchased a few years ago was able to stop known viruses and other known malware but brandnew unknown viruses proved more difficult Newer products do a better job of stopping them 

    For our antivirus tests we team up with AVTestorg a respected independent securitysoftware testing lab based in Germany AVTest rigorously tests AV products from a number of leading security companies The multifaceted testing procedure looks not only at how well an AV product can detect malware using traditional largely signaturebased methods that is employing a database of known malware types but also at how well it can block brandnew unknown malware AVTest also examines how well a security product can clean up after an infection in the event that a piece of malware does get through 

    Our tests focus on paidfor and free AV products Paidfor AV products usually offer better technical support and more comprehensive protection features than free programs but free is free Internet security suites go further still offering firewalls parental controls identity theft protection and more 

    Here we review the best antivirus programs you can buy or download in the UK right now Securing your PC is of course about a lot more than antivirus At the very least you need to run up to date antivirus antispyware and a firewall Youll find that almost all of the best antivirus software we test these days forms part of an internet security suite so all of the above and more is included 

    The trouble is some antivirus is better than others They all offer a blacklist of known threats and a whitelist of software that is known to be legitimate But these days new threats emerge every day and knowing what is friend and what is foe in realtime can be critical And thats where we come in AVTest challenges Windows security software to withstand threats both old and new known and unknown 

    We then combine that with our own experienced and expert tests of interface and system overhead We test antivirus programs for how much if at all they slow down your PC or laptop as well as how easy to use and how intrusive they are Thus you can see from our regularly updated list of the best antivirus for PC or laptop which is the best for you Best antivirus for protection best antivirus for performance and best antivirus for value Click through to read the individual antivirus reviews 

    
ESET NOD32 Antivirus is a sound antivirus product with some useful extras though its a bit surprising antispam isnt included in the product The software is easy to use and doesnt disrupt the normal function of a PC its running on Technically its a strong contender without being in the front rank
 

    
Panda Global Protection 2015 is a good option if you need to protect a range of different devices from Windows PCs to Macs and Android machines Not quite as generous as McAfees asmanyasyoulike offering and a point off the perfect score in AVTests testing the Panda product costs 20 less too and is particularly easy to use
 

    
GData Internet Security 2015 is relatively inexpensive for a fullfeatured security suite Its not the most successful at beating out web threats but it is sufficiently good to be worth installing A decent purchase if not the best
 

    
If you run a couple of home Windows PCs a Mac a tablet and a smartphone or a similar combination McAfee LiveSafe 2015 is an economical way of protecting them all and providing antitheft facilities on the mobile devices While the feature set of the IS component of the package may lack backup and PC tuneup the power of its AV protection cant be denied  

    
Avast Free Antivirus 2015 is one of the best free security products you can install It offers a surprising range of free goodies including application and browser app analysis and separately an excellent Android suite covering AV and antitheft A better than average AVTest rating completes a very impressive picture
 

    
Panda is one of the leading antivirus providers and this free offering includes a couple of interesting extras We were surprised at the time it took for both the initial and followup test scans but its protection levels are sound and its very easy software to set up and forget
 

    
If you want the extra features that Total Security 2016 offers over and above a plain free antivirus product then Qihoo isnt a bad choice And if you do install it you should head straight into the settings and enable the Bitdefender scanner  

    
BitDefender Free Edition will suit a certain kind of user one who just wants to install the software and let it do its job without recourse to setup changes or manually scans Since it has such a high protection score its safe to do this but if you prefer to have more handson control you may find this approach frustrating
 

    
Overall this is one of the best free AV applications youre going to find With perfect scores from AVTest a good range of facilities for a zerocost suite and a welldesigned interface which is easy to use and direct Avira Free Antivirus 2015 is a great choice to protect your PCs
 

    
A threedevice full protection IS suite for under 50 is good value and when that includes cover on all the major platforms it should be flexible enough for most Kaspersky Total Security 2015s technical strength cant be faulted with only Avira Anti Virus Pro matching it in the AVTest group  

    
This is one of the very best AV suites available in terms of outright protection against malware Its also very good at not throwing up false warnings but there are other products offering more auxiliary modules for the money  

    Avast is one of the three main contenders in the free antivirus world AVG and Avira being the other two As with those two there are paidfor products in Avasts range with more features but the free version has several useful features of its own See also Best internet security software 2015 UK 

    Avast makes quite a thing about its free antivirus offering giving a good breakdown of its feature set and companion programs online as well as naturally offering a range of upgrades to commercial products It offers two main functions antivirus protection and potentially unwanted application PUA detection for when bad apps piggyback themselves on legitimate downloads 

    Theres also a network scanner which looks at your network settings and passwords and suggests improvements to increase their strength The free package doesnt include antispam or a firewall and youll need to upgrade for password protection too 

    Free protection can be extended though by adding Avast Browser Safety also a free download which prevents ad networks from tracking your movements online blocks harmful web sites and offers slightly unexpectedly a price comparison when shopping There are free Avast AV apps for Mac Android and iOS too so you could protect all your devices with pretty much the same software 

    The main control screen is very clearly laid out and makes wide use of tiles demarcating all the important information Theres more info than you often get in free AV products too with a good statistics module covering both the work the software has done on the local computer and what it has achieved for its customers globally 

    Avast took over 1 hour 10 minutes to scan our 50GB basket of test files but it did look at 879891 of them giving a scan rate of 204 filess well up with some of the fastest scanners However theres very little difference in scan time on a second pass just a minute less so not much file fingerprinting going on 

    The Protection rating from AVTest was 5560 which seems a little harsh when in the two months of the test it scored a perfect 100 percent on both zero day and widespread malware detection in the first month and dropped just 1 percent still above the industry average on the zero day testing in the second month 

    The Usability category produced a perfect 6060 with only one false detection in the whole set of samples where the industry average was three This gives the product an overall score of 160180 a very respectable result for a free product though not the best in this group 

    Avast Free Antivirus 2015 is one of the best free security products you can install It offers a surprising range of free goodies including application and browser app analysis and separately an excellent Android suite covering AV and antitheft A better than average AVTest rating completes a very impressive picture 

    Antivirus software provides an essential layer of protection from viruses trojans worms spyware adware dialers keyloggers and rootkits However dont let the name antivirus confuse you These days every good antivirus has good detection rates for all forms of malware not just viruses The term malware includes viruses trojans worms spyware adware dialers keyloggers rootkits and any other software which performs malicious activities on a computer 

    Sadly the amount of malware currently in circulation is so large that no antivirus could possibly detect all of it Despite vendors claims no single antivirus solution can detect nearly all new malware There are some products out there including some in this review which include technologies which are able to adequately protect a computer but any product which relies mainly on detection is statistically doomed to fail eventually Also using more than one realtime antivirus at the same time uses much more system resources can cause system errors and can even reduce protection due to unintended conflicts For my advice on how to compensate for these weakness of antivirus products please see my other article about How to Stay Safe While Online Having a good antivirus product does go a large way towards adequately protecting your computer but in this day I would highly recommend that you add additional layers to your security arsenal 

    Below I have reviewed some of the most effective Free Antivirus products currently on the market In order to make this review more unbiased although I do of course admit that my own intuition and experience does affect my judgment as well I came up with a particular methodology for comparing these products This methodology is described in the following section 

    The main motivation behind why I came up with this particular methodology for this review is that I value system protection against real world threats above all other categories by which an antivirus is commonly judged It does not matter to me whether an antivirus protects the user by detecting malware blocking dangerous sites behavioral analysis sandboxing or any other approach The most important thing is that at the end of the day your system is safe from infection Thus that is the attitude I have taken towards reviewing these products My criteria is entirely based on protection not cleaning Therefore if you believe your computer may be infected please first see my article on How to Know If Your Computer Is Infected before continuing to read the rest of this article 

    I have located reputable Antivirus testing organizations which claim to test products against situations which resemble realworld situations I narrowed these down by further requiring that the organizations have a relatively long record of producing good seemingly unbiased results The organizations I ended up with and therefore used for this review are 

    From here I looked at all tests spanning back over the last two years However if there were more than three tests within that range I used only the most recent three Also if given the choice between results from different operating systems I chose that for the most popular operating system At the moment Windows 7 is the most popular operating system 

    Also I only considered results if it was specifically the Free Version which was tested This is because the results for the Paid Version of the products in this review with the exception of Comodo Antivirus which has the exact same protection for its Free and Paid versions are often quite different from those for the Free versions Many marketing teams try to cloud this difference but for the purposes of getting the most reliable information I am strict about this Unless it can be explicitly proven that every protection mechanism is exactly identical to the free version the results for paid products are not considered in this analysis 

    In addition I did not count it against any of the products if they were not tested by multiple organizations As long as they were tested by at least one within the abovementioned period they were considered This criteria was chosen because there are many reasons to choose not to participate in a test Thus it should not be held against the product if they were not tested by multiple agencies However if they were not tested by any this makes it impossible to compare them in an unbiased fashion 

    Once this data was collected I then looked at the overall results for the Free Antivirus products discussed in this review and ordered them mainly according to the quantitative results However my own knowledge of the products and the reviews and experiences of others were also considered The results are presented and discussed below 

    Comodo Antivirus is my top pick for advanced users or for Intermediate users who are okay with an antivirus software which will occasionally ask them for input However if you do not fall into those categories or for any other reason find it to not be a good fit for you then you will likely find my next pick suitable Also for those who prefer a complete solution there is always Comodo Internet Security CIS which is also free and includes a firewall in addition to all other components which already come with Comodo Antivirus 

    Firstly I will note that I am a volunteer moderator not employee on the Comodo forums However this is certainly not the reason I chose this for the number one position The reason I made this my top pick for advanced users or users who are okay with a somewhat talkative antivirus software is because it is the only product which I feel confident saying that it will protect you against nearly 100 of realworld threats This is because it maintains a whitelist of known safe applications Then all unknown applications which include all unrecognized malware will be sandboxed and isolated from the rest of the system Thus this product provides very strong protection against even zeroday malware 

    Comodo Antivirus also uses the cloud to facilitate the detection of the most recent malware as do many other Free Antiviruses reviewed in this article It will also analyze unknown applications for suspicious behavior and alert the user accordingly However as mentioned previously users who do not want a somewhat talkative antivirus should continue to my next pick Also by default Comodo Antivirus has small advertisements which can be disabled as shown here Also please see my notes in the Quick Selection guide for advice on how to avoid unwanted software during installation 

    Panda Cloud Antivirus is an excellent choice for average users who may find Comodo Antivirus too confusing It has a simple interface completely automated features access to cloudbased protection and has been shown to be very good at protecting a computer Panda Cloud Antivirus has a behavioral blocker web protection and access to cloudbased protection all of which will help increase your security The protection offered by this product is very strong However do note that it will autoquarantine files which it believes to be dangerous 

    Avast Free Antivirus has very good protection rates Avast has many different protection shields boottime scanning a behavioral blocker an internet site ratings plugin script malware protection and access to cloudbased protection Its arguable whether their ratings plugin offers comparable levels to Web of Trust but the script malware protection can prevent certain browser exploits a feature not available in any of the other free AVs reviewed 

    However do note that Avast requires a free registration to function after 30 days and the default installation installs the Chrome browser unless you uncheck it Also note that the OpenCandy advertising component is integrated into the Software Updater tool in Avast More information about OpenCandy can be read here Thus if a user selects this option during the install they will end up with OpenCandy on their computer My advice would be that if you want to install Avast you should not use the Software Updater tool 

    AVG AntiVirus Free Edition is also a good choice for average users My analysis of the results as discussed in the methodology section does show that it does a decent job of protecting your computer However it appears that the above Antivirus products tend to do better Also it comes with advertisements but they can be disabled 

    Avira AntiVir Personal Edition is another product which has a very good reputation However the free version was not tested by any of the three testing organizations I referenced in my methodology Therefore I cannot currently recommend it above any of the previously mentioned products 

    However other comparative tests do show that it has very high detection rates for malware Also many users have used it and found that it is very effective Also Avira provides access to cloudbased protection AntiVir is certainly a good choice for a free antivirus but due to the lack of realworld testing at this time I cannot recommend it above the other products in this review Hopefully in the future they will have the free version tested by these organizations as well 

    Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is another free antivirus product which has a very good reputation However the free version was not tested by any of the three testing organizations I referenced in my methodology Therefore I cannot recommend it above any of the previously mentioned products 

    The engine for this product appears to be very similar the commercial product although there are some tweaks However the level of protection provided has not been shown conclusively to be identical with the paid version which is why I did not use the results for the paid version in my analysis Bitdefender Free has both local and cloudbased definitions Thus users always have access to the most uptodate definitions It also has an effective heuristics engine and uses a component called the Active Virus Control to monitor applications in realtime for suspicious behaviors In addition it also has a webshield which seems quite effective at protecting users from both malware infested and phishing sites 

    The user interface for this product is very minimalist Thus it may be attractive for novice users although more advanced users may be frustrated at the lack of customization However it has no offline installer and it also requires registration to continue using it past 30 days Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a good choice for a free antivirus but due to the lack of realworld testing at this time I cannot recommend it above the other products in this review Hopefully in the future they will have the free version tested by these organizations as well Also note that if you are having trouble getting Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition to install in English please follow the steps in this post 

    EndNote Please note that I also looked into Forticlient  Kingsoft and Microsoft Security Essentials However I found that the protection offered by these products is subpar Thus if you are considering using Forticlient or Kingsoft I would strongly recommend that you instead consider another of the products reviewed in this article

    Regarding Panda could someone clarify what this means  it will autoquarantine files which it believes to be dangerous
When it does that to a file that I do not want quarantined 
 do I get a heads up
 and is it easy to undo the quarantine 
I am leaning heavily towards installing it in my main PC depending on the answer to those questions 

    I had used Avast for years but it was getting a bit wearing
I tried another one a few months back Cant recall the name but it is well known and gives us 1 year free
None of my PCs are newish and are a mixture XP and W7
I find networking somewhat painful mainly with W7 being too nanny
When I installed that what was its name antivirus my networking got much worse
After I uninstalled that whats its name my networking returned to its slight PIA state 

    I am currently running with no antivirus 3 weeks whilst deciding what to go with
I can reasonably get way with this by being careful in emails I always am and using FF with NoScript
All those minimalistic Chrome lovers out there that do not use FF  Noscript are unwise I tempered that a lot 

    Although I do not think only Panda does that restoring automatically quarantined files is as easy as clicking on the main inteface button on the top the whole interface looks like the new Windows start Interface with the squares and then clicking on the Quarantines View Details button There you will see all the quarantined items and you will be able to restore them If the folder the files were does not exist anymore it will move them to a Lost and found folder If it can find the folder restoring them will also tell Panda the files are harmless so it will not redetect them ever as malware  

    I consider Panda one of the two best lightweight Antiviruses and suggest it to people that want an antivirus with options For friends and users that just want an antivirus that will kill anything and they will never care to change settings I suggest Bitdefender It will brutally quarantine anything that it believes it is harmful be it you like it or not 

    Hi am the new editor here This article is pending a major update for the New Year so its not been updated yet Chiron our previous editor left so Ive big shoes to fill in Unlike our previous editor my results wont be considering the accolades that antiviruses have been getting at independent lab tests because the authenticity of these tests cannot be confirmed as they dont show you proof So Ill be doing my own malware tests on a virtual machine to consider the overall effectiveness of antivirus software  

    That being said its finally the users choice to choose what kind of protection that they need because no matter what antiivrus software you use its a safe bet that you will be protected unless you are deliberately calling for trouble  

    I just hope we are not going down the YouTube track of chucking a bunch of URLs at something knowing that in a few minutes they will have disappeared and then ranking product protection qualities based on their detection  

Its also worth mentioning that a stack of malware can recognize when it is being launched in a virtual environment
MC  Site Manager    Trust online is something harder to get than it is in real life for sure I am not paranoid myself when it comes to tests but I never cared enough if one antivirus has 10 and the other 5 labs points There are plenty sources that show more detailed tests which feel more trustworthy since there are details Indeed though knowing what the test tool does is something that would help us not so much understand but see results as even more trustworthy 

    For better or worse some malware do not hide only in virtual environments but also are able to hide in the system and stay inactive waiting for a chance when for whatever reason the antivirus will not be active and sneak up on the user  

    All antivirus tools have some misses and quite some of them have a good killing ability I am not sure if Avira is still one of the best but that one and Bitdefender seem to prefer to hit more false positives so they they will miss less viruses rather than being more lax and miss more viruses  

    With that said though Antiviruses are not anymore the perfect shield Users should definitely use a browser addon to add a first wall of protection be it like me an adblocker or any other addon that can block malware and afar from that use occasionally an antimalware solution 

    Although this is not the Best Free Spyware And Adware Remover list I wonder why in the current one tools like RKill TDSSKiller AdwCleaner and Junkware Removal Tool are not mentioned at least in a products that are worth mentioning list 

    But this is mostly not necessary for home users because basic protection provided by freeware antivirus is well and good for them Add together a couple of other free security products you are rocksolid Others who doesnt offer a paid for service has other sources of revenue  

    I have been repairing computer systems since 1989 and if there is one thing I have observed the antivirus tests run in labs are significantly different than what happens to users computers Basing a choice of antivirus upon the results of lab tests shows the media wants to avoid assuming any liability  they blame it on someone else What good is advice where no liability was assumed There are some informed comments here and I appreciate those who offer such responses It is obvious because they are not concerned about themselves they express concerns for all of us KUDOS to them 

    Ive been using Bitdefender Free for about 6 months now and while Im an advanced cautious user Ive had no issues with it It took a while to get used to just leaving it alone as in the past Id go in and tweak all the settings of my commercial antivirus
As the author wrote theres no conclusive evidence that the Bitdefender Free engine is the same as the paid but its pretty likely One area that the free is much better than the paid is in usage of system resources This is likely due to all the supplemental features the paid versions have At idle the Free version uses about 25 MB of memory as opposed to close to 250 MB for the paid Bitdefender AV Plus 2015 Consequently the paid Bitdefender uses as much memory as McAfee But I digress
My point is the free Bitdefender is a great product for either A a total set it and forget it user like an elderly relative or B a power user who has trust in the product and whod be able to tell if something were not right on their system 

    Heres the simple layered security setup I use on my Dell every day laptop
1 Bitdefender Free AV  set  forget
2 Windows Firewall  set  f9rget
3 Mcafee Web Advisor aka Site Advisor  for supplemental URL blocking and search engine result ratings Mcafee has the best product in this category IMO by far  far better than Bitdefender Traffic Light 
4 Malwarebytes Free  manual scan every 23 weeks 

    Win FW  Go to Advanced Settings  Top left side click Outbound Rules  Top right side click New Rule  Check that Program is selected  Click next  Check that This program path is selected  paste CProgram FilesAVAST SoftwareAvastAvastUIexe without quotes  Click next  Check Block the connection is selected  Click next  Check all the 3 options are selected  Click next  Paste AvastUI without quotes in the option Name  Click finish 

    UPDATE 
It seems blocking of AvastUIexe as mentioned above takes care of all the Avast craps ie no adspopups no upgrade button on the main GUI no ads on the main GUI no ChromeToolbar offers options during installupgrade etc 

    I uninstalled Avast Free But didnt remove the block rule for AvastUIexe from Win FW
I had a previous installer so installed Avast Free No ChromeToolbar offers options during install I then upgraded to the latest version  no ChromeToolbar offers options during upgrade 

    of course the internet is now abuzz with the announcement from avg that it now collects and sells your info so another product that i am done with added to these
Samsung spyware on tvs plus pups on phones
Lg spyware
Lenovo spyware and not safe chinese computers
Comodo adware
SOHO Routers
Seagate harddrivescome with rootkits 

    I do wish when posters tout something on here  as in this recent post about Moon Secure AV  theyd do more than tout but instead amplify their contribution in this instance with some reference to calibre of performance and provenance of producer Last I heard Moon Secure was an Indian enterprise which used ClamAV and then ceased business Thats about as staggeringly unimpressive as it gets  so why is this particular AV being promoted in this comments thread Looks like spam to me 

    Not sure about listing MSE Microsoft Security Essentials as unsuitable or subpar
It is true that they rank low on the test scores
But theres an assertion that MSE focuses on the most popular exploits
So we might have a realworld vs academic controversy here
Ie in an academic settings AV tests with contrived threats ie including some rare ones MSE doesnt perform well
But in the realworld with threats that are commonly seen it performs just as well as the others
Ie you have no greater chance of becoming infected with MSE than with any other AV
MSE is also free and fast so I would not demote it 

    My personal opinion is if you take the AV Tests and give them a good shake ie replace the threats tested with an different but equivalent set then everybodys going to score differently
So my opinion pick a fast unobtrusive one Thats MSE or BitDefender today but every year brings a new mix
Actually before coming here today i would have put Panda on that list but people here report popups
And supplement with Malware Bytes antimalware and Super Anti Spyware once a week
And use Sandboxie or VMware player or VirtualBox for risky stuff 

    Then uninstall it and use something else It is a free program I see nothing wrong with providers of free stuff trying to get you to upgrade to something that gives them some compensation for teir work If they do it in a way that is inttrusive to you then just move on Maybe buy a pay program  no ads well usually 

    I am puzzled by your comment about bloatwareopencandy with Avast I have installed it on three laptops and theres no trace of Opencandy on any of them I have found it very easy to avoid installing Chrome if I dont want it
I find an increasing number of nag screens in Avast and it does try to get you to upgrade  always at an alleged discount does anyone ever pay the so called full price
But the free version has been very effective in blocking all sorts of invasions so Im relucatant to abandon it for the reasons you give 

    Yeah me three Been using Avast for years on a number of computers and nothing extra has ever been installed by itself The popups are slightly annoying but are occasional and no real biggie The only thing you have to watch out for besides the Chrome install option and even that didnt show when I installed it yesterday via ninitecom is that during upgrades its easy to click install for the paid version 

    Comodo Internet Security is a multilayered security application that keeps hackers out and personal information in Built from the ground up with your security in mind Internet Security offers 360 Virus Protection by combining powerful Antivirus protection an enterprise class packet filtering firewall advanced host intrusion prevention and automatic sandboxing of unknown files 

    It is said that for the good you have a lot of pay It is also said that only paid security programs are able to provide adequate quality of protection Can we expect something more from free software Comodo Internet Security Premium The free version of Comodo is a fully professional version of the security system All the ingredients are high My overall rating 810 I would recommend  

    As recently as a year or two ago it was easy to pick a free antivirus package Almost any of a half dozen free virus scanners did an acceptable job and largely stayed out of the way of the OS when configured properly Times change however 

    A combination of increased malware and virus activity along with lax updates and regression on free antivirus suites has narrowed the field down to a handful of worthy packages Older chart toppers like AVG have fallen hard and fast while outsidethePC solutions such as routerbased antivirus scanning some routers offer fullservice antivirus solutions built right into the firmware blocking threats before they ever touch your PC have become new preliminary lines of defense Its a whole new world out there with more threats and vectors of attack but fewer worthwhile defenders 

    When it comes to the charts no free antivirus software comes close to Avira Number one in realworld performance and ahead of the other free packages in almost every independent antivirus research ranking Avira holds a commanding laboratory lead over the other free packages  

    Avira is also impressive when it comes to features A healthy suite of antivirus tools is provided with link scanning malware and rootkit protection present and accounted for although Avira isnt alone in this generosity AVG offers even more at the same gooseegg price tag 

    While plenty quick in Win 8 and 81 Avira struggles to keep up on Windows 7 systems which remain popular especially for gaming Another more serious problem is the lack of behavioral virus blocking Avira may have excellent threat definition files that get updated with the best in the industry but if the virus isnt on file youre pretty much out of luck 

    Avira also has a spotty record with adware phishing and malware Independent testing shows hitandmiss results producing scores that barely beat Microsofts builtin Security Essentials protection AKA the antivirus worlds counterpart to Notepad 

Aviras malware protection has improved somewhat in recent versions but theres a better way to deal with low and midlevel threats to your PC than allinone antivirus packages More on that in a bit    Despite these quibbles and the occasional nag screen Avira narrowly takes the top slot of the three free antivirus programs looked at here assuming the user faces normal to moderate threat levels Only a few competitors come close paid or otherwise to its mix of protection and performance Nevertheless if Avira doesnt appeal or you need better 0day protection than static definitions provide dont pull out your credit card yet there are other free options 

    Lightfooted Avast shadows Avira in protection scores and generally outpaces it with swift performance in the real world giving it the highest performance of the three packages here although subjective experiences in the lab didnt always bear out these results 

    More singleminded than other antivirus software Avast sticks to the basics and that pays off handsomely in independent performance and protection tests It also means Avast is a better system citizen readily partnering with other security software and sharing duties without creating conflicts between similar services 

    Avast also has a problem with false alarms issuing far more than either AVG or Avira which not only gets old fast but also teaches users to ignore warnings which isnt a smart route for security software to take 

    While theres no custom firewall or other exclusive highend features the package does provide link protection browser cleanup and a handy network vulnerability scanner along with a few other basic tools alongside the primary antivirus component For highrisk users the scanning engine supports behaviorbased virus activity detection and can stop unknown exploits before they are coded into definition updates 

Avasts combination of speed and features isnt enough to unseat Avira for general use but Avast tends to perform better in mid to highthreat situations especially when paired with good malware software    Once a top contender AVG has fallen to the bottom of pick list but remain a viable recommendation While AVG has always lagged a little behind in the others in outright protection and performance it more than compensated by providing an excellent overall set of features and the slickest user experience of the bunch There are matters other than software to consider however 

    While others in the antivirus marketplace spent the last few years adding features upping performance and polishing user interfaces the folks at AVG Technologies followed another route Theyve been busy pioneering an array of annoying popups that try to install security browser addons urge you to upgrade to paid versions or resort to other strongarm tactics that annoy as much as malware itself 

    The latest chapter has the company collecting cleansed customer data for possible sale to advertisers a decision they have decided to stick with over protestations from the userbase privacy advocates and security experts 

    Some of the annoying notifications can be turned off till the next update via buried options in the settings menus and AVG features the best free Windows 7 antivirus protection around and behavioral antivirus protection is included a testament to legacy code and better days 

    In a way the supporting players in the antivirus game are better than the allstars who soak up the credit and headlines You may have noticed the Panda package scored well in tests but wasnt included in the above recommendations Theres a reason for that 

    Pandas offering is an internetbased free antivirus service called Panda Cloud that makes an ideal second line defense that doesnt take on primary antivirus duties but can step in at a moments notice when youd like another opinion on a suspicious file 

    Its also a good fit for systems you need to trust temporarily Consider Panda the ankleholster antivirus option just remember not to have two background scanners or active virus blockers working simultaneously or they can interfere with each other 

    Many adware exploits slip by antivirus programs and while these arent usually as malicious as outright viruses they can still slow down a computer annoy and prove difficult or costly to remove Rather than rely on omnibus antivirus packages alone to stop these specialized tools such as Malwarebytes or Spybot are better bets for adware removal and detection 

    Scanning with Malwarebytes after a standard virus scan frequently reveals all sorts of adware infractions and generally removes them painlessly These misdemeanorlevel alerts are frequently overlooked by larger packages which spent most of their time and detection research stopping more serious threats Like Panda this suite should be on standby next your primary antivirus package 

    One of the best ways to keep your system virus free is simply to run Windows Update regularly Microsoft historically applies patches to Windows on the second Tuesday of every month a tradition called Patch Tuesday If youre worried about one of the many Microsoft muckups regarding patches just wait an extra week or so before applying them Problem reports are usually in by then so you can skip any troublesome updates until the software is sorted out 

    Another way to keep your system secure is via hosts file editing The hosts file is used by your computer to map IP addresses to names and can be edited to map the addresses of known trouble or advertising sites back to the internal loopback address of 127001 meaning they wont connect to your system 

    You can find an excellent regularly updated free hosts file block list here and can implement it with a simple text editor giving you regularly updated malicious URL blocking for free sans dodgy security toolbar search addons Its also a pretty painless way to block ads If you find a blocked site you need access to just delete it from the loopback list 

    Last but not least dont forget to keep a tool like CCleaner handy to erase caches histories passwords banking data and other leftover information if security is of special concern A compromised system cant send secrets it doesnt have An occasional system sweep duplicates some of the functionality found in paid options of antivirus software Theres even a secureerase function 

    While each of these antivirus suites sports a specialty theyre all thoroughbreds With most results only a few percentage points apart its more a matter of matching your needs and workflow than winnowing out weaklings 

    For protection and the comfort of the best overall numbers Avira is the perfect pick If speed simplicity and zeroday protection are top concerns Avast is sure to please If its features you want AVG has them all along with a few annoyances that give pause but arent worth dropping it from consideration 

    Dont forget however that the key to system security is not to rely on any single antivirus package by itself but as part of an array of defenses with antispyware routerbased protections and AV cloud services all employed alongside one another to provide multiple independent barriers against security threats While no system is truly impervious this is as close as youre likely to get especially for the price 

They have made it worse there are no graphs no historical data no component status with viruses blocked virus chest or scan count no realtime data with shields activity download info or last MoreI have been trying for over an hour to uninstall avast from my computer and it refuses to let me It is acting like a malware itself It is not my computer as it works uninstalling everything else More    It doesnt take a genius to tell that the threat of viruses and malware has been growing exponentially with time Their shadow looms over the entire internet Threatening to engulf your personal information and use it for maligned intentions or simple disclosure to the public Newer and newer viruses keep popping up everyday thereby making it essential to guard our system from the constant threat posed by them 

    Lavasofts AdAware has been a pretty reliable spyware tool It offers smooth installation nonintrusive notifications along with detailed custom scanning The UI of the latest version has been vastly improved as compared to the previous version Several features have been incorporated such as Sandbox emulation scheduler and a command line scanner That being said there is a lot of scope for development of the rootkit detection and phishing protection provided by the Antivirus 

    FortiClient is an effective and efficient Free Antivirus which boasts of web filtering a firewall network optimization and parental controls It also provides very good phishing detection and even includes a VPN Client With no perseat license fees FortiClient with its onaccess resident protection enables users  guests to work efficiently anywhere without compromising on their security Although the network optimization seems only to be effective for FortiGate Devices and it is also less effective at blocking certain malicious URLs Moreover the functions of the VPN Client and Parental Control system are also limited 

    Based in China Qihoo 360 offers a wide range of comprehensive effective and userfriendly Internet and mobile security products aiming to protect the users computer and mobile devices against malware and malicious websites Supported by cloudbased security technology the 360 sets itself apart from all other Free Antivirus software through the usage of three different AV engines comprising of Qihoos very own checksumbased engine a machine learning QVM engine and a BitDefender local engine These comprise Qihoos own checksumbased engine in the cloud a machine learning QVM engine It provides a sandbox too through which one can check out for the threats posed by unknown programsThe program lacks out in providing a parental control system Firewall or Backup facility 

    One of the best Free Antivirus currently available The Comodo Antivirus includes a full range of detection engines for viruses rootkits spyware and other malware It uses Comodos proprietary Defense technology thereby guarding your system from all unknown files by treating them as a threat It also provides OnAccessResident protection cloudbased protection and an automatic sandboxing function Since the program occasionally asks for User input it may not be suitable for amateur users The Host Intrusion Prevention System and phishing protection still have a long way to go 

    Malwarebytes is one of the most widely acclaims and highly appreciated malware detection solution It is pretty small lightweight and doesnt require signatures as well It also shields Java and perhaps is one of the most effective software against zeroday attacks that have never been seen before 

    The biggest drawback with it is the requirement for proactive antivirus software that can work alongside it It just acts as a complement to your regular antivirus program There is also a major lack of features in the free version as compared to the Premium version But that being said Malwarebytes still is one of the premier and most reliable products when it comes to catching the newest most cuttingedge threats that other antivirus companies may not have caught yet 

    The BitDefender Free Antivirus is one of the most unobtrusive antivirus available on the Internet today It provides for a Realtime Shield Active Virus Control Intrusion Detection Rootkit scanning and HTTP scanning as well The newly introduced feature of Profiles which adapt the software for particular tasks like watching movies playing games or general office work has improved its userfriendliness by a huge margin as compared to the previous versions Moreover it even includes online banking protection a 2 way firewall and a parental control system Although poor technical support combined with the difficulties faced in installing on systems that are already infected by malware may cause problems to the average user 

    The Panda Cloud Antivirus takes Free Antivirus to a whole new level with its cloudbased scanner The software is also lightweight and runs of a local cache when the network is unavailable It offers effective phishing protection and impressive detection rates combined with topnotch rootkit blocking But it falls behind other Free Antivirus software due to its inefficiency at eradicating malware from already infected system 

    Ranked as one of the best amongst Free Antivirus software Avira boasts of exceptional detection and blocking rates Its small footprint makes it ideal even for older PCs Offering seamlessly fast scans it also boasts of antimalware protection antispyware protection browser protection and cloud based scanning as well Although one could find the interface too cluttered and the installation and execution process to be quite slow as compared to other Free Antivirus software 

    Definitely one of the most popular Free Antivirus software AVG needs no reckoning Furthermore the 2015 version has been revamped to provide a better user interface a cloud based scanning system and the ability to block infected links besides the usual detection and eradication of viruses It is also one of the smallest Antiviruses and also provides script malware protection 

    Editors Recommendation I would prefer Avast over other free antivirus hands down The plethora of features that it boasts of sets it apart from all others Effortless installation an all encompassing heuristic search engine and on access protection pack quite a punch Its features such as realtime protection of files email P2P transfers web surfing instant messages and even suspicious behavior are a notch above your average Free Antivirus software It has been praised for its performance and light use of system resources and has also proved itself efficient in catching malware as well Further developments made in the 2015 version to enhance the user interface merit Avast its place on the top of our list

    Antivirus software isnt necessarily the most glamourous of tech but its crucial if you want to keep your computer running quickly and healthily Fortunately theres plenty of free antivirus protection out there to choose from 

    Free antivirus programs have been around for years In the early days AVG was the best free antivirus but theres no shortage of terrific options right now Weve tested the four most popular free antivirus programs to find out which is best 

    While the internet is arguably safer now than it was in the dark days of Windows XP leaving your PC unprotected is still a bad idea This is doubly true for inexperienced computer users who tend to be less adept at spotting common phishing scams dodgy websites and bogus installers 

    We look at the features sets offered by each free antivirus package in the review and the ease with which they can be used and their settings adjusted Most packages can be set up and largely forgotten but we also want to know whether they cover all the fundamentals youd expect in an AV suite and what extras are on offer 

    We do our own performance tests by timing a scan of a known 50GB basket of files and dividing the time by the number of files scanned We then run the test a second time to check how well the software has fingerprinted the files its already scanned so that it doesnt have to rescan them if they havent changed 

For most of the testing however we rely on results from AVTest wwwavtestorg the wellrespected German antivirus test site which regularly evaluates groups of all the major players in the marketplace    The company evaluates the packages under three separate headings Protection Performance and Usability Protection looks at the effectiveness of the software against both established threats and zero day attacks where it has to rely on heuristics and behavioural analysis 

    Performance checks out the hit AV packages can have on the regular running of a PC It goes further than our tests in looking at its effect on other tasks such as visiting websites downloading installing and running software 

    Finally Usability looks at the softwares ability to avoid false warnings or blocks of legitimate software while installing or running it It uses a set of over 525000 samples to evaluate this performance 

    From these three categories each scored out of 60 AVTest gives every package an overall score out of 180 Software that scores over 120 is certified with the AVTest Award showing that it has achieved a good level of overall performance 

    Always be careful to check any software you put on your computer is suitable and compatible with your existing setup No liability can be accepted for any individual problems caused by acting upon the information given 

    For Windows 7 8 81 or 10 just click on Start go to Control Panel and click the Windows Update icon where it will show you if there are any updates for your PC The same goes for users with Windows 8 or 81 Sadly Microsoft is no longer releasing updates for XP 

Mac users and Linux users have slightly less to worry about in terms of viruses as there still arent as many floating about for them Nonetheless Mac users should grab free antivirus software too     Dont use the same login for lots of sites If one falls into the wrong hands your whole online life is up for grabs Try picking one and add a few letters related specifically to each site youre logging into 

Most web crime still happens via email so be on guard when checking yours Dont open any attachments youre not expecting or click any random links you find in the text see the Phishing Scams guide    The way around this is to make sure youve added senders whose emails youd like to receive to your accepted list The same goes for this sites weekly MoneySaving email its combination of freebies money mortgage and debt info means it can easily get caught in spam filters 

    Only give out your email address to people you know Dont post it on public internet forums including MoneySavingExpertcoms or chat rooms Spammers often use software robots or bots to read all forums store any emails and spam them 

    If you download your emails to a computer eg using Microsofts Outlook you can create rules to stop common spam by entering key words eg VIAGRA so those emails are automatically filtered But spammers try to beat it through misspelling words or using numbers in place of letters eg V14GRA so youll have to block out other combinations too 

    Looking for a piece of software Find out which company makes it first and then go to its site to get it there rather than from a third party site found via Google For smaller free or shareware programs try using big sites such as Downloadcom rather than just getting them from anywhere that shows up 

    These are transmitted via websites email attachments directly over the internet or via any other removable media They hide in applications or files and spread from computer to computer generally wreaking havoc wherever they get the chance 

    Trojan horses are hidden within a harmlesslooking file eg a picture of a celebrity or progam ironically theyre often dressed up as antivirus tools They aim to trick the user into installing malicious software like spyware or adware 

Worms take advantage of any open internet connection They try to sneak in and replicate on the computer Once loaded they often start to send spam email from your computer without your knowledge    Its a common misconception that producing computer viruses is the domain of angstridden teenage geeks with little to do showing off to their equally reclusive peers While there may have been some truth in this at the beginning and of course it still happens these days its often about big criminal business 

    Some viruses allow your computer to be controlled via a DDOS attack This is where a website is closed down due to simulated simultaneous use by millions or even billions of users This can be for political reasons a ransom to hurt competitors or just for fun 

    Many people whose computers cause this are unaware its happening MoneySavingExpertcom has been hit by such an attack Ironically some of the people denied access for three days couldve been contributing to the closure via hidden viruses on their systems

    Its not just about how uptodate your software is If youre not using it whats the point Try to fit in a full ondemand scan once a week where the virus scanner flicks through all the files on your hard drive This should make sure nothing slips through the net 

All MBNA cardholders signed up for Online Card Services can get a years free access to McAfees Online Banking Suite which includes its antivirus spyware and adware programs and moreAnd HSBC customers can get 12 months McAfee VirusScan Plus RRP 40 for nowt  after the first year youll have to pay full price or uninstall it Forumites are sceptical about it though    Microsofts Security Essentials antivirus package is completely free to users of genuine Windows machines so itll verify your copy Two versions are available for Vista and Windows 7 Sadly XP is no longer supported 

    The softwares unobtrusive and provides quick and comprehensive protection from viruses trojans and spyware For casual Windows users it feels and runs like part of the regular operating system rather than an added extra But some experts say its not as good as it used to be 

    Windows Defender runs in the background and tells you when you need to take specific action You can use it anytime to search for malware if your computer isnt working properly but reviews are mixed on how thorough the scans actually are 

    The free antivirus software of choice for many techies Aviras won many tech publications free antivirus roundups by providing both the most thorough and fastest software protection If you have the knowhow itll do everything you want it to but its best for those that know their way around a PC 

    Panda Securitys free Antivirus 2016 software has been highly praised by reviewers and has scored well on tests carried out by antivirus evaluation site AVTest Plus it includes additional features not often found in free antivirus software 

    For example it prevents USB drives running software automatically when inserted into your computer  as well as vaccinates your own USB sticks against infection from other PCs  and a monitoring function to highlight security information about current running applications 

    AVG is unobtrusive doesnt use too many resources and will regularly autoupdate It includes LinkScanner a realtime threat detector which checks links out when youre surfing the web on Firefox Internet Explorer and Chrome only and marks unsafe threats with red flags 

    Simple to use Sophos antivirus for Macs runs in the background while you work scanning files for threats whenever your Mac opens them Its had fab reviews in techie publications but has been known to slow down some systems 

    So why arent we all going firewall mad Well we tend to connect to the web via a router rather than just a modem and routers provide a hardware firewall Make sure yours is switched on and set to a highenough security level Consult the manual or search online for the make and model number if you dont know how to check 

    While youre there check youve changed your router password from its factoryset default Youd be surprised how many connections are hacked and how much havoc gets wreaked because the standard password hasnt been changed Spend a little time to get your settings right here as router firewalls give a higher level of protection than software ones 

    Windows XP Vista 7 and 8 have a firewall builtin which should be enough for most people especially those who already have router firewalls but make sure its switched on and your copy of Windows is uptodate The firewall can be set on low medium and high levels of protection 

    If the Windows firewall is set on high you may need to spend some time tweaking its settings in the Control Panel to stop it becoming a nuisance By default itll stop you downloading files over Skype and itll block a whole load of programs that download from the web 

Agnitums Outpost free edition is a good allrounder and has a good combination of top protection and userfriendliness Its totally free and there are no messages nagging you to buy a copy    Its totally free but youll need to register and activate the licence by email within 30 days of installation While Comodo outperforms many similar offerings it can be intrusive especially if you just want a firewall that does its job quietly 

    Since the early days all webready Macs have come with some sort of firewall as standard Which yours offers depends on what version of OSX youre using To turn it onoff and change the settings go to System Preferences  Security  Privacy  Firewall 

    There are other types of malware you can find on your computer Often legitimate developers will design programs that have useful functions but theyll also provide the owner with useful information about you or try to sell you things 

Its easy to assume these are related to the site you were visiting yet often they arent If youve closed your browser but popup windows still appear on your desktop chances are youve been infectedMalicious spyware programs have become much more advanced in recent years undoubtedly due to their potential for criminal moneymaking so some of yesterdays top spyware removers can no longer cope    If youre being troubled by adware use a popup blocker to alleviate the symptoms while you find a solution Be aware though that not all popups are bad  some sites open new windows in this way If you want to see them hold down CTRL while clicking the link 

    There are a couple of legit spyware programs Googles Desktop can send info on what youve been searching back to Google and Alexas toolbar can do the same In both cases these firms want to monitor your computer to help develop their products with data about searching habits 

The usual way for adspyware programs to get on your computer is by attaching themselves to other things you download So make sure you check the veracity of download sources before getting files    Like most antivirus tools spyware removers work by comparing whats on your machine to a list of known offenders As ever the top antiadspyware programs are commercial but that doesnt necessarily mean you need to buy them Try these first 

    AdAwares great at detecting and removing malware and this new version works even faster than previous ones On the downside most features are locked in the free version If you make it your primary tool you wont be fully protected 

While the free version doesnt provide realtime protection or scheduled updates AntiMalware is still powerful enough to make a big difference As a lightweight program its pretty quick too    Spybots been going for a while and while it has a pretty long list of features its always received mixed feedback Its fairly processorhungry so if your computers already slow itll be an unwelcome addition 

    SecureMacs MacScan software is built to detect isolate and remove spyware apps as well as blacklisted cookies saved on your system Its a 30day free trial youll pay 40 26 to upgrade if you like it Reviews are mixed so if it doesnt work for you just delete it once the trials finished 

    Not really an antispyware tool but AVGs LinkScanner is worth a look for Mac users It uses realtime threat detection which checks links out when youre browsing the web Firefox and Internet Explorer only and marks unsafe ones with red flags so you know to avoid them 

    Weve all had moments of horror even in this very office where due to hardware failure power cuts or just plain ol silly mistakes precious documents disappear As more and more of our lives are committed to the digital domain backing up data is becoming increasingly important Since there are ways to do it free youll only have yourself to blame if you dont 

    If youd rather keep more tangible copies of your files the options are either storing them on CDs and DVDs youll need a CDDVD writer or on an external USB hard drive for biggermore files As technology marches on the latter are getting increasingly cheap 1TB 1000GB for as low as 40 if you buy online 

    If youve already lost valuable files there may still be some hope in the form of recovery programs Freeware programs Restoration Recuva Puran File Recovery and PC Inspector work to recover lost files but as you may expect its a lottery as to whether they actually succeed

    Antivirus apps are truly one of the most controversial genres in all of Android With all the stock protection getting malware is all but impossible so many pundits will say that you dont even need one of these Even though that is true there are people who feel safer with third party protection and dont mind paying for it Really its a toss up If theres a great antivirus Android app that weve missed please let us know in the comments 

    Editors Note Thanks to a change in how Google handles SMS permissions starting in Android 44 there isnt a single antivirus or SMS blocking application that can block SMSMMS on Android 44 KitKat Thats actually a problem caused by Google and their implementation of Hangouts However many of these antivirus applications list SMS blocking as a paid feature knowing full well that it doesnt work on KitKat and took absolutely no steps in warning their potential customers that this is the case Thus all antivirus apps that list call blocking as a paid feature and dont mention that it doesnt work on KitKat took a hit to their ratings Those who list it as a free feature did not because its not a feature people are paying their hard earned money to use It should also be noted that all antivirus apps that dont list their subscription rates in their app description where they belong took a hit to their rating while antivirus apps that provided their price details in their app descriptions got an increase to their rating Transparency matters 

my buddys sister makes 87 every hour on the internet
 She has been unemployed for 6 months but last month her payment was 19402
just working on the internet for a few hours go right here CashfigCOM    Your Alt keys by default only give you characters found in your default MSDDS character set from character 0 to character 255 If you type a larger number then this method wraps that is Alt256 gives the same value as Alt0 Alt257 gives the same value as Alt1 Alt258 gives the same value as Alt2 and so forth until the values wrap again and again and again until you get to Alt3232 which indeed gives you   

    If you type Alt3232 in Microsoft Word or in Wordpad you will get  because in those applications only if you type a value over 255 you will get the Unicode character that corresponds to the decimal value that you typed  

    On a web page and in most forums you can just enter an HTML entity For  the hexadecimal HTML entity is   x c a 0  without quotation marks or spaces The corresponding decimal HTML entity is   3 2 3 2  without quotation marks or spaces Place either entity on a web page or forum and it will convert to the character when viewed provided the viewer has that character in a font and provided the browser properly supports automatic font replacement Otherwise it will appear with an unknown character glyph  

    but the problem is that their 1 year license is only arround 5 without support and 10 for 1 year prety normal they do offer a lifetime license if you want to support them this is in no way mandatory most good package are rated at 75 doesnt see this as a serious review 

    If you download apps from Playstore only  there is no single chance you can get any kind of malware And even if you side load them from your PC  most PC antiviruseswell not counting Drweb as antivirus here scan them for all known malware for android too 

    And since Linux system doesnt allow to get any common viruses from simple browsing downloading strange content is your choice  Any antivirus app will just sit there slowing your system and eating battery
I suggest installing one like once in a month or 2 Run trial scan system and delete it  profit 

    Absolutely not true You really should check your facts The Play Store isnt monitored like iTunes and while malicious apps may be rare they arent unheard of Just try searching for BBM Android malware on Google 

    If you were following Google You d know that since October 2012 Google play has built in malware scan for all app uploaded by developers This scanner got 2 big updates and is really up to date now Also there is loads of free anti thief solutions that are well known and didnt load youre system with antivirusPrey is one of the most trusted for me Also there is one from Google And one for custom roms from cyanogen team  

    If you read carefully article in the linked site  you install app from Google Play that has no malware and than app itself asks you if you want to download an app separatly and downloads it from private server as separate apk file not from Google play Any app can link you to website  its up to you if you agree to sideload app from there 

    Really This article proves otherwise Zoner is one of the more popular antivirus apps on the market with users which would reflect in their comments and yet it only scored 68 in the AV test now to me a 68 is failing This was mentioned earlier ironically in the comments before yours Im guessing you didnt read the comment section but just scanned a few and decided to comment on one 

    Also most comments left will be from users without much user experience You are going to trust a bunch of comments from new users kids teens soccer moms etc when most of you constantly are critical of the writers who work in the industry Please explain how that makes sense We have all looked at the reviews and comments on particular apps that have excellent reviews and comments from 100000 or more users and have thought these people dont know what the F theyre talking about This app sucks Or something to that effect  

    Oh by the way a lot if the reviews and comments on apps are paid for There are users who download the app rate the app write a comment remove the app and get paid Its not much at all but if you do enough of them it adds up 

    Playstore is monitered U got your facts wrong Plus with malwarebytes it also scans every store download and not even once has it detected any virus Theres more junk on this website than and playstore app  

    YEs Lookout was one out t of the first anit virus apps to and was the only one in the playstore
I never really liked LookOut because no mater what it always interfered with something huge battery hog couldnt receive calls people could barley hear me when I talked to them over the phone never got text messages nor was I able to send 

    took me awhile to figure out but once I uninstalled LookOut everything went back to normal
I use ESet mainly because Ive had it on my computers and I think it is one of the best security suites next to AVG and Kapsparskey 

    And I dont know about the mobile version but McAfee is a bitch to get completely out of your system Or at least it used to be They may have fixed that by now It just attached itself too tightly to too many files 

    Ill tell you what Ive used most of these at one time or another on phone laptop or pc and I have Avast and CM on my phone now But until someone finds a way to mess it up CM is the coolest security system Ive ever dealt with 

    Its strange that some authors dont even try to get enough information before posting an article If you want to write about an antivirus you must look at the AVtests AA lists Zoner who got a bad score as you said and Norton which has an impact on performance but they dont talk about Comodo Kingsoft or Kaspersky 

    So what does that test say about device compatibility customer satisfaction resource usage extra features price and availability AVs tests dont measure those things We do All of these are capable and finding the big problems that people are most likely going to run into  

    I understand that and its normal to include these into your review but you cannot include an antivirus that gets a low score at an AVtest eg Zoner gets 68 which is way below the average 952 For an antivirus consumer opinion is less important that its score 

    The point I was trying to make was that Zoner made the list for far more than just its antivirus functions It does a lot more that people could find more useful Also even at 68 it still probably catches and blocks the most common and dangerous malware Android can be infected but lets face it you only get infected if you do something really off the wall like downloading an app from an advertisement on a website that sells black market organs or something crazy like that Most Android users will never find themselves in a situation where theyll even come into contact with that other 32  thank you for the comments 

    I am new to smartphones but I thought antivirus was an important issue When I started my research for the best AV I had no intention of getting other miscellaneous functions There are countless other apps for that Is AV pointless as would be this list and discussing it considering I have no plans of downloading an app from an advertisement on a website that sells black market organs or is it actually important If I need AV I would want one that is free and the best at handling viruses malware and spyware with a popup blocker Something that runs in the background and is easy on the battery and data usage I am I asking for to much What is the bottom line on a simple highly effective AV and how necessary is it in the first  

    Truth be told the miscellaneous functions are what people really want If you follow the rules and dont disable the stock Android security features theres pretty much no risk of anything bad happening to you 

    none you only have to check them out and try to understand why that app is asking that permission
for example if i saw that a calculator ask permission to read sms to the dial to gps etc etc ill be a bit perplexed but for other app maybe that permissions can be necessary 

    And in addition to what Dario753aC said always remember that most developers on Google Play are using those permissions for completely legitimate reasons Dont immediately be alarmed about permissions for accessing contacts making phone calls etc
If its a very mainstream app Like Pandora Radio most of the time you can rest assured that they only want permissions for contacts to provide the typical socialsharing functions youd expect or if an app wants access to the phone dialer its usually just there so you can call a number directly from an app or something stimular
Every permission has a legitimate purpose You just have to be aware that once in a while permissions will be excessive Always email the developer and ask them why before leaving a bad review You can judge by the way they answer if they have something to hide Stick to applications that are well known or come from well known development teams and dont ever be one of the first 1000 people to download an application from a completely unknown developer with no traceable history Wait until there are plenty of reviews to give it your trust Other people will always get curious You dont need to be a lab rat Let them have a crack at it first
If you stick with those very basic tips you should never need an antivirus 

    Im not sure whats more depressing That people think they need an AVP on an Android phone or that sites like androidauthority keep pushing this bull on folks Makes me think they should remove the authority part of their website 

    If this is that bad for you then why do you come here and read these articles Why take the time to write defamating remarks I just dont get it For me I agree that AVP is a waste of resources for me but if other ppl want it then thats their business I didnt pay for their phone and I dont have a right to tell them what they should or should not use The publisher wrote a list of apps because the ppl asked them to Not because the are trying to be THE Authority on others phones 

    ahahah i agree never understood people that has not root dont install external apk dont do anything with their smartphone but facebook and whatsapp and they wanna have an AVP why what do you expect about that do you think youre using windows XP 

    i wanna told what a friend of mine said we were discussing about usefull of AVP and she said that if you dont have an AVP on your android you get a lot of malware and virus only surfing the web with the browser ahahahhaha i was laughting at her too much 

    its the best one to do what i dont think that you need an antivirus on android if you dont install cracked apk so dunno how you can say that one is not good and another one is goodin my opinion on android the antiviruses do a lot of other things not concernig with virus as permission management privacy settings and possibility to find your device in the case youll loose it 

Lookout Security 45 rated is free and provides antivirus scans apps pre installation and routine antitheftloss I have it installed on all of my devices and it has worked flawlessly for years    A new user with a cheap weak GB paygo phone Ive been interested in this topic more for data on the phone and SD than the phone itself After poking around this eve Ive decided BitDefender is the least demanding  most effective Supplemented with Android Lost app for phone recovery the phone is reasonably covered with tiny resource requirements and no cost  

    My only concern so far is that Android Lost might be disabled if the current Gmail account is changed by some moron who wants to steal a 50 phone Im not sure if other phone finder apps have this problem Ive looked at AppLock and similar but they dont seem to add much to my polka dot lock screen that any finder or thief would have to get past Any advice about that would be welcome

    What about Lookout Samsung is going to be including it with all of their future phones very soon giving us another reason to root and remove the bloat Anyway I still think that AV on Android is entirely useless Just be careful what you install and review the permissions Dont root if you dont have to and dont grant root to everything that asks for it You should also disable root for ADB so a savvy thief cant easily hack your phone These AV apps are glorified progress bars and just add lag to your system They also want to sync your data to their own cloud which is not cool considering my contacts photos etc are already backed up through Google Sure the AntiTheft features are good if you dont use Android Device Manager but unless you want to pay to feel more secure I wont be loading any of these apps In fact I scanned a friends phone which had a bad apk that was popping up messages The scanner didnt even find it let alone block the advertising 

    What I want for my rooted phone and Custom Rom is real security so if I lose my phone someone cant steal my ROM image backups or clone my entire phone CyanogenMod 101 is offering SMS encryption between Cyanogen peers Other than encrypting my entire phone another performance hit are there any other ideas out there 

    Im new to smartphones so to the benefit of those that are likewise or that may have questions regarding AV on android I offer this link I found while researching the issue It tackles questions like is the play store malware free what is the main threat to android phones and pros and cons of security apps  

    ok ill try to make it easy if you use linux you maybe already know what root is
anyway root is a part of system you cannot wrote because you can damage the firmware just think about dialer modem gps config boot image if you wrongly cancel a part of that you can damage your firmware and a part of that will not work
so producers dont allow you to wrote that part of system but if you get root access in your phone you can have access to that part of firmware and modify that so there are some apps that requiers access root because they have to access that part of firmware for different reasons 

    in you pc especially in windows you can think about the different type of users there are normal users and administrator in fact when you use a normal user you cant do something and you have to enter with the administrator user 

    but in PCs you already has root acces you only have to log in as administrator in phone it is blocked by producers in order you cant damage the system so in phone you are like the normal user and you have not possibilty to be the administrator user if you dont unlock root access with some zips 

    so we were talking about virus its really improtant that if you got root access on android you dont give root access permission to all the apps you install because when you give them root access they can compromise your system thats why i said that if you dont install cracked app and you dont give root access to all your apps you really dont need to have an AVP 

    I spoke to TMobile tech support re wifi calls While on the phone a pop up said my memory was low but it isnt Tech guy said I could have a virus I said that I have Lookout Tech guy said Lookout could be the problem Um What Im NOT savy re these things so what do I know Now Im just wondering if I should reset my device to factory default  exclude the Lookout install or what  

    Antivirus programs are also memory hog Just yesterday my relative was fixing a computer for someone who had Norton The computer had a 235 GB hard drive and Norton created a 166 GB backup WTF That means that everything else on the hard drive only took up 69 GB and the backup took more than all the other files and the OS on the hard drive I reccomend downloading a file manager and clearing out your internal storage and then do a factory reset to get rid of the antivurs program alltogether They are tricky to get rid of You should find a folder called Lookout or something and delete it 

    I have a galaxy note 2 I dont know how many apps you put on that thing but I dont think spyware is going to make a pop up like thatand after dealing with Time Warner techs I dont know how many times let me tell you the guy doesnt know what hes talking about He actually tried to tell me that the speed test app didnt workand its impossible for their lines to get congested no matter how many people are on it LOL SHOOT ME NOW 

Sorry for the misuderstanding The anouncement says the app will be free this year However the app is available for a while 
Cheers mate    Im using BitDefender because its so light it has a negligible performance impact with a good reputation It does appear these services are unnecessary for the time being but its cheap insurance Dont know why the writer says it only system scans in fact it scans every app install and update and briefly shows a flag that the app is clean 

    If you download apps from those kind of websites you do need an Antivirus If you just install apps from Play Store you dont necessarily need one but check the permissions especially SMS contacts and location access 

    Companies cant give away their product for free and remain in business Period They are making a profit how Perhaps tracking you and selling your data Wake up mindless Droids pull your head out and look around I also noticed a lack of any testing whatsoever Reviews based on the amount of downloads Really 

    NQ Mobile Security and Antivirus is very secure and protective Secures the web as well as phone and its applications Awesome update Great interface Wish they introduce option of daily scanning Wow extra complete mobile security app ever in a very friendly and affordable price I love this app Excellence jobkeep it up buddy 

    I like my lookout app I pay all my bills by encrypted phone call and only my credit card number may be in devices but it is a protected credit card so I wouldnt be held accountable and theres no banking account information or anything embarrassing in my devices By the way I think anyone convicted of identity theft should serve a minimum of 25 years in jailif youre an illegal alien and commit that crime serve it in the jail of your country 

It is the second article first is  that given me an insight to learn which is the best free antivirus software however I wanna know which is the best  a free version or paid    Android smart phones are on the rise now a study conducted  an american university of data and electronic gadgets has proven the more and more people are using the cellphone for to log on to social networking site and to check their emails with this rise ti has become a target for hackers and malicious persons to make virus spy wares and other malwares dont be a victim and leave your private data vulnerable to the blood hound crooks get secure NOW with a trusted antivirus for your phone and tablet today  

    a word of warning on Lookout its a good app and served me well since my first android device buthad a major issue with it recently after purchasing a Gear 2 Neo device
Lookout would freak out and would start running my Note 3s CPU at 100 until the phones battery died or the phone was restarted you could not stop it no matter what you did Uninstalled and havent had issues since seems others had similar issues with Lookout  

    ESET employee speaking here let me correct one small fact  virus definition updates are available for everybody  the difference is that in premium version they are downloaded automatically while with a free version you need to tap a button to download the newest updates 

    Iv personally tried every single one of these apps on different android htc mid range devices and only eset was the best one for theft recovery use of anti virus that dont make the handset crash or start laaging on the installed apps 

    Start working at home with Google Its byfar the best job Ive had Last Wednesday I got a brand new BMW since getting a check for 6474 this  4 weeks past I began this 8months ago and immediately was bringing home at least 77 per hour I work through this link go to tech tab for work detail 

I got Cerberus for AntiTheft it works perfectly fine lookout came installed never used it
Avast works really well too interested in trying CM Security as it was mentioned to be lighter on resourcesThankx for the articletons of choice which is wht I love Round this time last year discovered I had a Heuristics Shuriken Thats is why I will never go near anything that is remotely close to McAfeeThere are few more simple tips and techniques that are very effective You should take these preventive measures in order to protect your devices security I would like to share here     If All you need a lightweight  efficient antivirus scanner you may consider this Antivirus Security Virus scan This has High Ranking Antivirus Security in TOP FREE TOOLS Currently 40

Features  

    The package size of this Antivirus is below 15 MB total space its consume is approximately 5  6 MB in comparision to 1530 MB of many popular antivirus for android on googleplay such as Avast Antivirus AVG antivirus CM Antivirus 

    I have mentioned on my blog post that CM Security is the life time winner I personally use Cm Security for a year and I very much impressed I guarantee you never back down once you use CM Security You can check out why I like CM Security more to other security apps 

    Few days back I shared an article having few fine antivirus apps for Android Devices 
Just few minutes back I was going through an article on Lifehacker where Antivirus programs were one of the programs which are not good for Android device Though I feel that antivirus programs also protect from the virus which is mostly carried in our SD card
Though I shared only 6 Antivirus programs in my list which are also listed in your list I would like to update my article soon with the remaining ones Glad that I landed here 

    I used to have CM It would do a complete scan in less than 1015 seconds Sorry but that just doesnt seem right I now use Avast and it takes more than 3 12 minutes for a complete scan I have no faith in CM None whatsoever  

    If this was Windows and theres plenty of driveby malware that can occur if youre running Internet Explorer and such then obviously you need a minimum level of virus protection on your PC But this is Android and driveby malware doesnt infect the phone like that right 

    So if you just stick to the Google Play store and mostly just install the TripleA apps like Whatsapp Hangouts Instagram etc etc then what is the danger here Why would need all this virus protection apps then 

I dont mind my latest find a lite antivirus that is under 2mb in app size It even caught a new virus in a game as soon as installed from google play store I am impressed     Even this antivirus is too cool   It even monitors every app install to ensure security  that new app is virus free This light antivirus is also about 2 MB in size light  efficient antivirus security for 2015 

    I like to have a security app that protects and cleans my phone in one app Unlike Clean Master and CM Security where you need both to clean and protect your phone I found PSafe total and 360 Security to be the best that fits my needs 

    At one time I tried CM and it would do a scan in a few seconds I now have Avast and it takes around eight minutes to do a scan No way CM can do a complete scan in a few seconds Theres enough Chinese crap sent here Im not taking Chinese security on my phone and tablet 

     They say you dont get something for nothing but when it comes to protecting your PC against online threats thats not the case There are plenty of free antivirus tools around that can automatically block malicious code and scan the files on your PC to ensure youre not unknowingly harbouring something nasty In this article we bring you the best free antivirus packages of 2015 to keep your PC safe 

    For those running Windows 7 or Windows Vista the default option is often Microsoft Security Essentials  although you will need to have downloaded it via Windows Update or from Microsofts website If youre on Windows 8 or newer then Windows Defender comes preinstalled and ready to intercept viruses and spyware  

    As antivirus programs go Security Essentials is as straightforward as it gets most of the time you wont even know its there and it has very little impact on the responsiveness of your system In our independent testing throughout 2014 it consistently allowed more malware than other free packages to slip through the cracks but its turned it around dramatically in 2015 now offering performance that is better than some paid alternatives 

    However if youre on Windows 8 or newer then sadly Security Essentials isnt an option  and going by the respected security experts over at AVTest wed recommend installing thirdparty antivirus software Windows Defender puts in a reasonable performance but its still some way behind the likes Avast Free Antivirus 

    Possibly the best known alternative is AVG AntiVirus Free which has been providing free virus protection since the 1990s The modern AVG client actively detects and blocks viruses and also integrates with your browser to warn you away from known dangerous websites 

    Recently weve seen AVGs overall protection results improve markedly from a lowly 76 in the period of JulySetember 2014 to a respectable 94 in our most recent tests see table at the bottom of the page for a full breakdown 

    Our favourite free antivirus tool however remains Avast Free Antivirus  as it was last year In our tests this package gained not only an impressively high protection rating but it did so in the safest possible manner by preventing them from gaining any kind of foothold on our test system This enabled it to maintain an edge over AVG which protected against the same number of threats but allowed more through before neutralising them than Avast 

    Avast is also light on resources and shouldnt noticeably slow your PC down and although like AVG the frontend includes advertisements for paidfor products theyre less plaintive For all these reasons Avast Free Antivirus is our recommended free antivirus package 

    Our most recent tests have seen Avast lose its lead over the rivals here but Avast remains a likeable easytouse package that delivers effective virus protection It is a touch behind Microsoft Security Essentials for overall performance but if youre on Windows 8 or newer its well worth installing 

    Security Essentials has come on in leaps and bounds  it performed better than third party security software from Avast and AVG in our most recent tests If the other features supplied by Avast or AVG appeal to you then by all means switch but theres no need to install anything else to boost your protection levels 

    Additional testing by Dennis technology Labs carried out during January and March 2015 expanded the tests to include Panda Free Antivirus The results indicate its an improvement over Microsoft Security Essentials but that it cant match AVG or Avast for performance 

    Pandas malware protection score isnt bad at 90 nor is its false positives rating which is 94 However its closest rival AVG has been steadily improving of late and performs significantly better particularly when it comes to false positives For the ultimate in protection meanwhile you might want to consider Avast or 360 Safe see below instead 

    Each packages core antimalware features are tested at the stateoftheart facilities of Dennis Technology Labs Rather than artificially infecting the target systems they are set up in an environment that mimics how our PCs become infected in the wild to get an accurate picture of how each security package fends off malware in realworld situations 

    We look at whether the package provides protection and also how it handle each threat The resulting data informs a protection rating of up to 100 Meanwhile we also install legitimate software to see what the security packages block and where they prompt for use r intervention factoring in the obscurity or otherwise of the application We award a second score for false positives where 100 represents a perfect record 

    After formal testing we run through each package to check its other features and get a feel for its usability and its burden on system resources We measure the latter by monitoring RAM and CPU consumption over the course of basic scan also timing how long these scans take to complete All this information is factored into the final Overall star rating youll see at the top of each review 

    screw the dumbass windows defender it sucks ass i have avast antivirus scanner its better its been around longer than windows defender that dumbass thing lets a shitload of viruses get into ur computer enjoy the piece of shit windows defender and McAfee which i might add is a young company and doesnt have much experience as avast does theyve been around since the 80s ur an idiot for removing third party apps that are virus scanners enjoy ur virus infected computer for keeping the dumbass windows defender only 

    If youre clever then youll know that if you knew what you were doing on the Internet then you wouldnt be using such top of the range products in fact if you know 100 then you dont even need an Antivirus program to protect youAnd by the way Microsoft shares their knowledge with third parties such as Avast to improve third party discoveries and third parties take all the credit for it 

    dude ur blind i had a trojin virus and the dumbass windows defender couldnt delete it also avast and macafee did and so did avast they detect viruses much better than shitty windows defender u sir are an idiot 

    Thats the worst virus you can get and sometimes when a virus gets on your system theres nothing you can do about it my friends gf got a virus and it created several Itunes icons before it crashed and she was unable to boot back into Windows and that was Avast protection my mate had Avg still got infected 

    For fixing clients pcs though I use MSE and MalwarebytesFor me when I went through the amount of junk on my mates 81 updated Defender found several browser hijackers and it fixed them Malwarebytes found some Malware 

     Immediately when I setupa pc make sure its setup properly the main problem that adults have with their kids is games which is all they want the problem in Windows is the default Admin account and having 100 unrestricted access to play a game you dont need Admin you dont need that for anything unless youre changing something100 pc problems affecting pcs are done using Admin 

    dude ur really stupid just use the virus scanners i mentioned windows defender cant protect u from bad websites or stuff like that i cant stand my stupid dumbass computer saying activate windows defender it sucks even when i uninstall avast it says windows defender is insufficient so yea it cant delete all viruses and it cant protect u form everything 

     you obviously have a problem with your system whether it be virus or currupted file or changed settings your current setup cant be that good because whenever i did a clean install of Windows for the first time for a client i never got given an insufficient error nor did i get the annoying activate Defender error from your vision of it it doesnt make any sense 

     third party firewalls work similar to the built in firewall they have more features but do the same job all they do is warn you if something attempts to change somethingWindows does that if something isnt on your allowed list it will challenge itsome might say hang on are you sure you want to do this youre not going to say no if you want to do something once you say yes to any Firewall it cant do anything it assumes youre comfortable with the changes 

    on my pc Win 7 all the latest service packs and updates installed Microsoft security essentials installed with Malwarebytes antimalware free i do everyday use in a standard user accountand enter a password when i need to change or install somethingI do update Microsoft Security essentials and run a quick scans often and have run a full scan once a week if i do get infected it has been because i downloaded something and its been flagged as suspicious but isnt actually an infection just a false alarm all of the time i use it the machine is clean 

    i run disc cleanup and disc defrag regularly restart my pc regularly i dont download from unknown sources i will always go to the official link if it works i dont click on random ads taking me to other websites i dont click on suspicious emailsI dont give remote access to the PC to anyoneThe broser i use is Google Chrome Microsoft Security essentials has been more than enough for me 

    well mybe it is enough if you are visiting one or two usual sites but if you are visiting or downloading from many different sites youll need more cause if you visit av test org youll notice microsoft security is the worst 

    im aware that over the past 2 years i think some of the Antivirus reviews have been negative about it but i also know that Microsoft have been always been slammed for poor security patching the amount of security holes and a back door 

    Windows 10 wont hassle you to install an antivirus like Windows 7 did Since Windows 8 Windows now includes a builtin antivirus named Windows Defender But is it really the best for protecting your PC  or even just good enough 

    Windows Defender is essentially the latest version of Microsoft Security Essentials a free antivirus program Microsoft offered for Windows 7 Now its builtin ensuring all Windows 10 PCs have some baseline level of antivirus protection 

Antivirus is already running out of the box Windows Defender automatically scans programs you open downloads new definitions from Windows Update and provides an interface you can use for indepth scans    But how good is this Well truth be told Microsofts antivirus is a bit behind the others when it comes to comparative antivirus software tests Weve sounded the alarm on this before and we were particularly worried because we had previously liked Microsofts antivirus product so much 

    Windows Defender has a lot of advantages Its builtin wont harass you with popups and requests for money and is lighter than some competing antivirus solutions It wont attempt to harvest your browsing data and make money from it as some free antivirus programs have started doing in an attempt to make a profit 

    Overall though Windows Defender doesnt provide bad protection Assuming you keep Windows uptodate  which happens automatically now  and use an uptodate browser avoiding potentially dangerous plugins like Java  you should be okay Windows Defender and with the standard computer security practices you should be following anyway do a fine job 

    Despite the low scores offered to Windows Defender by AVTest  just 056 for protection  Windows Defender caught 95 percent of the widespread and prevalent malware in June 2015 along with 85 percent of the zeroday attacks BitDefender managed 100 percent and 100 percent of the tested samples while Kaspersky managed 100 percent and 99 percent So despite the wide difference in scores Windows Defender still does a solid job In the past Microsoft has alleged that it focuses on malware thats actually prevalent in the real world while the tests arent representative and other antivirus 

    Windows Defender should probably be fine for most PCs along with some common sense and other good security practices However if youre regularly downloading pirated applications and engaging in other highrisk behaviors you may want to skip Windows Defender and get something that does better against the collection of obscure malware samples used to test antivirus software 

    We also recommend an antiexploit program to protect your web browser and plugins which are the most targeted by attackers MalwareBytes AntiExploit is the free program we recommend here It functions similarly to Microsofts own EMET security tool but its more userfriendly and offers more security features This helps block common exploit techniques even if they are zeroday attacks that have never seen before MalwareBytes AntiExploit would have blocked all those nasty Flash zeroday attacks you heard of recently for example It hardens your browser plugins and other targets attackers frequently target defending you against the most common attack techniques rather than attempting to catalog and defend against every known piece of malicious software 

    Windows Defender plus MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a good free lowhassle combination of security programs we recommend to keep the average Windows 10 PC secure Enterprise Windows 10 PCs would often have Windows Defender running along with Microsoft EMET but Windows defender and MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a better combination for the average home PC 

    MalwareBytes itself is a solid antimalware program that functions well as a compliment to any antivirus program including Windows Defender It finds a lot of the potentially unwanted programs PUPs and other junkware that a typical antivirus wont find but MalwareBytes AntiExploit is a separate program 

    If youre looking for a free antivirus solution Windows Defender really is fairly solid But if you want something else be sure to avoid installing whatever toolbar or browser extensions the antivirus wants to install Free antivirus companies have turned to bundling software and harvesting data to pay for those free antivirus solutions 

    Windows Defender will automatically disable itself when you install a thirdparty antivirus and then reenable itself again if you ever uninstall that thirdparty antivirus Its designed to get out of the way 

    Selecting an antivirus that has better protection scores against obscure malware you may never encounter may help make you a bit safer but other security practices are more important Ensuring you stay safe and keep your system secure is more helpful 

    And considering the scariest attacks these days are zerodays that use holes in browser plugins and plugins themselves to compromise your system MalwareBytes AntiExploit will likely offer better real security against the actual most dangerous attacks than a replacement antivirus 

    Something of note with BitDefender Free and Windows 10 I run BitDefender Free on most of my systems and I purchased a Windows 10 Surface Friday While installing my usual suite of programs I found that the notification and default Start button stopped working The culprit was BitDefender Free With no settings to make adjustments I had to drop it in order to get it back in working order Not a huge problem but something I found people were running into and getting frustrated with 

    I used to use Bitdefender but then it started getting bloated demanding and annoying so I stopped using it 2012 version There were constant warnings etc and it drove me up the wall Bitdefender was great until they started adding a lot of unnecessary items to it like a wallet etc I called their customer service and they told me the constant warnings were to protect me If your security software is a constant annoyance why have it 

    I went back to Kaspersky and that is where I plan to stay Kaspersky has been around for a long time and they have a great track record I have it on my Android phone as well I do not download pirated or dangerous applications but many people have been hit by flyby malware just browsing the web Remember the one that claimed to be the FBI and highjacked peoples computers My daughter got hit with that one  

    How sad to see Java labeled as dangerous Ive removed it from my machine but then discovered that some very reputable web sites could not accessed without it so its still on my machine No problems so far anyway BTW Kaspersky lets us download their latest version as long as the subscription is valid My version was having issues with Windows 10 but their latest 2016 edition works perfectly 

    The problem is finding a reliable pure AV product like MSE Unfortunately a lot of the mainstream alternative are loaded up with extra security junkware that in turn cause other issues and complications 

    You didnt mention Eset If you go to Virus Bulletin VB 100 Awards you find that Eset has passed 91 time failed twice and not submitted four times since 1998 Check that against any other antivirus vendor Eset is the most consistent software on the market as far as Virus Bulletin is concerned 

    On my wifes Win10 laptop I am running Avast Free MalWareBytes Antimalware and MalWare Bytes AntiExploit SpywareBlaster and ZoneAlarm Firewall Only two are from the same company and to me that means alot like the AV not having loopholes in the firewall to connect out Right now I am working on a registry hack that will allow me to uninstall Windows Defender and Edge as I refuse to trust any Microsoft browser 

    I downloaded Panda Free precisely because PCMag recommended it Every day it gave me several reminders that I was using the free version and I should get the paid version I understand the need to make money but I dont need that annoyance I uninstalled it and went back to Defender 

    I agree with the recommendation for Malwarebytes AntiExploit for protecting against most browser infections I regularly remove such infections from my clients computers and I install both Malwarebytes AntiExploit and Malwarebytes AntiMalware along with a good antivirus like Kaspersky or Panda for enhanced protection after the cleanup With Panda be sure and uncheck the 3 addon offers at the bottom of the installation splash screen As mentioned above these provide useless adware redirection Driveby or flyby downloading sites seem to catch my clients most often with unwanted software and infections 

    I have win 10 pro with updates blocked so I can apply them at my convenience However once you start updates you get all of the outstanding To me it seems like Defender is almost a Trojan Horse Defender updates are very often and if you want to stay updated then you get all of the other updates also 

    Why doesnt anyone ever mention IOLO System Mechanic Ive been using their Pro version for more years than I can remember It has served me well and kept my PC clean and virus free plus cleaning the system and defragging the hard drive One wonders if the ones you recommend pay How to Geek to do that and IOLO dontRegards Colin 

    Were big fans of hacking the Windows Registry around here and weve got one of the biggest collections of registry hacks youll find Dont believe us Heres a list of the top 50 registry hacks that weve covered 

    What I use is what I use My choices have nothing to do with this site or any other Ive used System Mechanic in the past and it worked well I have tried all kinds of different products over the years but over the long haul I prefer Kaspersky which also protects against malware etc For regular cleaning I use CCleaner and for defragging I use Defraggler by Piriform Ive also used Malwarebytes for many years but it does not get along well these days either Bitdefender or Kaspersky I keep a download on hand in the event that I ever need it Its really a matter of choice and preference I you are happy with System Mechanic then by all means stick with it 

    I used to love Bitdefender but started having problems with it very much like you experienced They took a simple product that worked well and added a bunch of unnecessary stuff that caused problems so I went back to Kaspersky and life is good 

    Probably gonna stick with my triumphant trio of Avast FreeInternet Security later on the main computer bc its the on I care more about Ccleaner and Spybot They work well together have yet to become bloated after many updates although Spybot wants me to upgrade to its full version but is very passive about that and do their respective jobs without much fuss or muss and few issue Dont see why Id want to use something that hackers would specifically target when far better programs are on the market

    You shouldnt have to install all updates just to get updates for Windows DefenderIf the Settings app doesnt let you pick updates to install you should be able to just open Windows Defender goto the update tab and click update to only update Windows Defender 

    However for people who do internet banking and store sensitive personal information on their machines I have never been able to get my head around why they economize a few  on an full antivirus security suite license when the protection of their life savings are at stake 

    Malwarebytes AntiExploit looks like a good product However when you look at how it works    the premium version appears to be the equivalent of Microsofts free EMET which I installed and set to Maximum security  

    Defense in Depth  I put a tick in the box for each of these items from the Australian Defence Signals Directorate the Australian equivalent of the NSA and GCHQ for my home computing environmentDSD Top Mitigation Strategies 2014 

    Im just a home PC user thats on the Internet six hours per day Windows Defender has never ONCE informed me of a detected malware or virus so I have no idea where this article gets their info saying Defender detects 95 If it does maybe it does so without informing the computer user Who knows As for me I dont use Defender I dont antivirus software either I mean really Do any of you need to be informed when your system has been infected by a virus or malware I know I dont Plus most antivirus programs cant completely remove viruses and certain malware anyway plus they tend to slow systems down to some degree What I did for myself years ago was I learned how to properly format my hard drives then reinstall my operating system updates drivers and software This way I never have to worry about viruses or malware I automatically get rid of them completely when formatting my hard drives and starting over And I have a greatrunning PC whenever I want without the need to pay money to someone else to do the work I go through the process every four or five months usually when website pages load slowly no matter what browser Im using at the time When one browser starts to load pages slowly  I download and use another browser  works for me Antivirus software is a waste of time and money except for companies and businesses in my unprofessional opinion 

    The problem with antivirus and malware suites is that they rely on signature listsThey dont all pick up everything This is how you scan your computer with all of themedit by mod link removed no shameless self promotion without prior approval Thank you 

    Someone mentioned above a lot of false positives by Malwarebytes They were faulty registry strings leftover by program uninstalls First of all isnt it a good thing to get rid of garbage like that 1 to Malwarebytes even if that wasnt an intended resultMy personal routine when I choose to really check my systems is to first thoroughly clean out stuff like that do all my updates and then scan for viruses 99 of the time I never see anything in the scan results except stuff that needs to goLike someone else said above one program isnt going to get it all Its best to use an arsenal I right now use Avast Spybot and the Malwarebytes antiexploit and Antimalwarebytes Because of this Windows Defender isnt running on my systembut I may uninstall Avast and give it a shot 

    Windows 10 wont hassle you to install an antivirus like Windows 7 did Since Windows 8 Windows now includes a builtin antivirus named Windows Defender But is it really the best for protecting your PC  or even just good enough 

    Windows Defender is essentially the latest version of Microsoft Security Essentials a free antivirus program Microsoft offered for Windows 7 Now its builtin ensuring all Windows 10 PCs have some baseline level of antivirus protection 

    I have never downloaded the Microsoft Security Essentials but I distinctly remember the issue of Windows Defender being deactivated on my Windows 7 systems andon my old Vista desktop In other words I didnt have to wait for Windows 10 for me to have itits been around for some systems at least since Vista I skipped the 8x abomination entirely

    Although official production of Nintendo Entertainment System games ceased in 1995 home brewers have been cooking up games ever since in 2012 Sivak Games released Battle Kid 2 Mountain of Torment for the 1980s era game system 

    The applications lightgray interface is straightforward and selfexplanatory featuring a navigational pane on the left that consists of five primary buttons and a realtime graph that aggregates shield activity and allows users to quickly check the overall stats of their computer Although the software automatically updates and enables subtle popup notifications by default users can easily turn off either feature if they prefer greater manual control or wish to subdue the alerts entirely The software is also relatively lightweight hovering around a paltry 750MB in size and tailored for Macspecific malware A builtin firewall or parental controls would be nice its tough to argue with more than 25 years of service and a sprawling user base 

    ClamXav is not your typical antivirus software The opensource software is barebones and rudimentary in nature designed as a graphical user interface for the open source ClamAV antivirus engine while still boasting the same functionality youd likely find in most paid antivirus apps The app can scan individual files or entire folders ondemand on access or on schedule subsequently detecting and quarantining both Mac OS X and Windowsbased malware swiftly and efficiently 

    It doesnt handle email scans quite as fluidly and methodically as Avast  the detection system is often overly aggressive when it comes to pinpointing potential threats  but it is capable of removing malware from your mailbox and allows users to save their favorite scan locations for quicker access Also although ClamXav is natively powered by the ClamAV engine those familiar with code can incorporate their own engine build instead adding substantial flexibility catered more toward opensource aficionados than the everyday user 

    The program is also relatively light on resources clad in a gray minimalist interface that makes starting and halting scans a breeze and comes equipped with a tool known as Sentry that conveniently monitors changes to specific files and folders opposed to your entire system The softwares biggest drawback aside from occasionally sluggish scan speeds is easily how infrequent virus definitions update Still the sheer level of flexibility ClamXav offers gives the software a slight upper hand above its closedsource competition 

    If offering an entire history of Mac malware dating back to 82 isnt evident of a developer on top of its game I dont know what is Straddling the line somewhere between necessity and excess Sophos offers all the basic utilities youve come to expect from quality antivirus software The utility offers custom ondemand and scheduled scans for specified files folders and drives along with additional tools for deleting and quarantining any software Sophos deems as a potential threat 

    The software even incorporates a Live Antivirus feature that will quarantine unknown files that are merely exhibiting suspicious behavior in line with that of malicious threats  a tool that could potentially be seen as overkill but is a reassuring precaution all the same Although the program has a tendency to scan slower than most its fairly lightweight and nonobtrusively performs vital background tasks while barely leeching or exhausting your systems resources 

    Despite the notable feature set Sophos manages to fit each facet of the software within a compact cocoabased interface that looks and feels like a native Mac app Initiating a fullsystem scan can be done directly from the top of main interface while additional options for more specific scans are discretely housed within a dropdown menu located at the bottom of the window Additionally its malware definitions are constantly being updated ensuring the program is never without the latest knowledge of potential threats Its one of the most handsoff antivirus programs on the market and as such sits among the best 

    Bitdefender Virus Scanner does not live up to its premium brethren Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac in terms of scope or functionality However the lightweight app remains a capable piece of software for those seeking basic protection against Macbased malware and its Windows counterpart Its built upon the companys awardwinning antivirus engine and features a host of scan options allowing you to quickly perform deep scans of your entire system or those targeting specific locations If you grant it access the streamlined program even provides an option for scanning critical locations  such as your Macs launch agents and the entirety of your system library  thus allowing you to bypass lengthier scans when pressed for time Moreover it automatically updates with Bitdefenders hourly malware definitions prior to scanning while providing a quick means for blacklisting specific locations from system scans 

    Some things though not all are worth the wait Although German security firm Avira took its sweet time regarding a Mac incarnation of its beloved antivirus for Windows the company built a Mac version that remains completely free for all users  whether being utilized by private consumers professionals or even multinational corporations The software strikes a nice balance between ease of use and quick access to advance utilities ultimately rendering basic system scans just as simple to execute as those that are scheduled and filespecific The software is equipped with standard spyware and adware protection along with the ability to intercept harmful websites and block tracking and comes bundled with 5GB of online storage in addition to oneclick deletion of malicious files 

Very Light and fast download scans are very fast Excellent malicious web filter blocking Many features Excellent detection rates You CAN set to automatic scheduled scan I do not know softonic MoreGreat idea keeping all the scanning on the cloud to save processing power Terrible execution I kept experiencing problems on my PC one of which being my connection dropping continuously so I More    Free antivirus software can do a surprisingly decent job  as long as you dont want any frills Paid antivirus software still outperforms the free stuff catching more malware and having fewer false positives detecting and even removing threats that arent there  an error that can hurt your computer Youll also need to do without some features that can be helpful features and are found in paid software like protecting you on Facebook and Twitter or when youre paying online with your credit card  

    Free software also peppers you with ads which can get pretty annoying as they nag you to upgrade to the companys premium read paid versions Still if youre looking for nocost nofrills antivirus software these programs are getting better and better every year 

    Panda Free Antivirus 2015 Free is an Editors Choice at PCMagcom AVTestorg gave it a perfect score for protecting Windows 81 systems in a test it ran in SeptOct 2014  equal to the best paid product Panda didnt fare as well when it came to system impact or usability and exceeded the industry average when it came to incorrectly identifying legitimate software as malware At AVComparativescom the Panda antivirus engine scores well in tests gauged to measure effectiveness Advanced or Advanced ratings but only the lowest acceptable rating Standard when it comes to its impact on system performance User reviews at Downloadcom are solid and it earns a 45star rating from the editors there 

    Panda Free Antivirus offers many of the same protections as the paid version of Panda That includes realtime antivirus and antispyware scanning and the monitoring of files and processes to spot brand new viruses based on their behavior It can also warn you off of malicious web sites Theres also a tool that lets you create a bootable rescue USB drive that can scan and clean an infected computer Downloadcoms Eddie Cho warns that it pays to pay attention during install as default options can switch your preferred search engine and browser start page  of course that type of annoying behavior is part of lots of free software and even some paid products Beyond that installation is easy PCMagcom reports and the user interface is clean and modern 

    There are lots of other free antivirus programs worth considering Avast Free Antivirus 2015 Free is recommended by one independent reviewer and is a Downloadcom Download Pick Its also adored by users All versions earn an overall score of 45 stars following more than 26500 user ratings at Downloadcom and thats outstanding compared to the feedback that most security software receives at that site the current version scores similarly well following more than 300 ratings At Amazoncom more than 8700 users team up to award Avast a score of 46 stars  

    Lab test results for Avast are kind of all over the place but largely point to a product that performs better than most free antivirus software though a step behind the very best paid products AVTestorgs results reveal that Avast Free Antivirus 2015 performs on a par with other products free and paid when it comes to malware protection and above average when it comes to usability and freedom from false positives However it extracts a higher than industry average hit when it comes to system slowdowns At AVComparativesorg Avast does a good job of correctly identifying malicious files but its falsealarm rate is literally off the charts  the exact opposite of the finding at AVTestorg Otherwise the software earns solid Advanced or Advanced ratings when it comes to malware prevention and minimal impact to system resources  the latter another contradiction to the AVTestorg findings Dennis Technology Labs gives Avast an AA rating its second highest score  

    One place where Avast has an advantage over most free and some paid antivirus software is that it is relatively feature rich The big plus is the ability to analyze your entire network for security holes including your router and any wireless devices Browser Cleanup goes beyond just cleaning out caches and cookies by letting you remove unwanted toolbars and extensions you may have unwittingly let thirdparty software install Software updater looks for new versions and patches for popular software

    Lots of optional configuration Avira works just fine out of the box capable of running system scans without slowing down other tasks like loading webpages or editing a document But if you want you can change settings like the number of days before Avira warns you that its definition file basically a book of virus mug shots is out of date You can also specify what types of compressed files you want to be scanned or ignored ignore specific files or processes target specific file extensions and search for root kits before scanning Its unusual to find this many options in a free antivirus app  and you must have administrator privileges to change anything so secondary accounts cant log in and tamper with it

    The term antivirus software stems from the early days of computer viruses in which programs were created to remove viruses and prevent them from spreading However over the years different types of malicious software often called malware emerged as threats to personal and work computers worldwide Malware is an umbrella term to describe several different kinds of malicious programs including computer viruses 

    Although antivirus software evolved to combat new malware the term antivirus stuck even though the term antimalware is truer to the softwares capabilities To give you an idea of the different types of malware out there weve identified malware types that are potential threats to computer systems today 

    Worms These malicious programs are designed to replicate themselves quickly with the intent to spread to other computers often through a computer network Although they may not be designed to intentionally impair computer systems worms generally do some sort of damage or harm to the network itself by consuming bandwidth at the very least Most worms are designed only to spread as quickly as possible so they may not try to change the computer systems they pass through However worms have been and are capable of creating backdoor security vulnerabilities deleting files or even sending files via email This is a common method for spam senders to spread junk email quickly as the more computers the worms infect the faster the spam mail spreads 

    Trojan Horses Trojan horses or Trojans for short are different from worms in that they are not designed to replicate themselves Rather Trojans are designed to trick you into downloading and executing them to cause data loss theft and sometimes totalsystem harm Just as in the ancient Greek story of the wooden horse designed to deceive the soldiers of Troy Trojans present themselves as useful interesting or routine programs to trick you into installing them on your computer 

    Spyware This software is designed to gather information about you without your knowledge This information can be sent to another party without your consent and in some rather malicious cases it can even be used to take control over a computer Spyware is capable of collecting any type of data including your internet history and banking information Some forms of spyware can install additional software or change your internet or browser settings which can be a mere annoyance or a problem that can take days to fix 

    Ransomware This incarnation of malware infects your computer with the intention of restricting access to your computer system perhaps preventing you from surfing the internet or accessing the hard drive and then demanding a payment to the malware creators The trouble with this software is that it tries to imitate the look of genuine trusted software to trick you into buying a solution For example some forms of ransomware tell you that your user license for a particular application has expired and you need to repurchase the license Some of the trickiest ransomware creators have acquired millions of dollars from unsuspecting users 

    Rootkits Rootkits are stealthy types of malware that attempt to hide from typical methods of detection and allow continued privileged access to a computer This essentially means that the rootkit attempts to gain administrator access on your computer and then hides itself so you dont know it is on your system This type of malware is generally difficult to detect and remove because it tries to embed itself thoroughly and deeply into your computers system 

    Malware is not limited to these five examples but this gives you a sense of how malicious and vicious malware can be Fortunately antivirus software is designed to combat these threats by preventing the programs from entering your system and quarantining and removing any malware that does get through The best way to protect yourself from malware is to update your computer system when prompted and to purchase thirdparty antivirus software that protects your computer 247 

    You may ask yourself why you need antivirus software when your computer comes with or makes readily available free antivirus software found in Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials Windows Defender has been available since the Windows Vista days as an antispyware program designed to monitor and detect programs that try to gather information about you without your knowledge With the release of Windows 8 Windows Defender was upgraded to offer additional antivirus protection features Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender built in to the operating system itself Microsoft Security Essentials offers antivirus protection against viruses spyware Trojans and rootkits and it is available on Windows XP Vista and 7 but not on Windows 8 

    Although Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials offer builtin support and Microsoft continues to improve upon these systems they dont generate high scores in the tests conducted by AVTest the respected independent antivirus software test lab This is expected to a point as these programs were designed as a baseline of protection for users who dont plan on purchasing commercial antivirus protection However AVTest regularly publishes its test results comparing both Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials to the top thirdparty antivirus programs The thirdparty systems score higher every single time 

    So is antivirus software necessary when Windows already has builtin protections against viruses Although baseline virus protections can give you some sense of security you want the topperforming antivirus programs to make sure you are always protected AVTest tests two separate categories of malware or virus interception the detection of widespread and prevalent viruses and the detection of zeroday or brandnew malware attacks In both categories of tests Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials performed poorer than the industry standard regardless of which Windows operating system was used during the tests This means that thirdparty antivirus programs are more capable of protecting your computer and you against malicious virus attacks Visit our learning center to find out more about how the top antivirus software can help you secure your computer 

    As you search for the best antivirus software youre going to run into free software that claims it is as capable as paid programs If you were to rank antivirus software categories into three different tiers youd find free software in the bottom tier with the least functionality and protection Although free software can be enticing free antivirus protection is not as capable as paid software All free programs can scan for viruses but only some of them scan for malware automatically and offer realtime protection or browser addons to help you avoid bad links Most advanced features are limited to paid antivirus programs 

    One annoyance of free antivirus software is that each program displays ads for the full paid version of the product This doesnt detract from the free versions performance or capability but it can be distracting and annoying Some programs even immediately launch your web browser and link to their companys website if you click on a feature that isnt available in the free version which may be minor but annoying nonetheless 

    Perhaps the biggest frustration with even the best free antivirus programs is the general lack of support offered by the developers Paid programs generally offer extensive technical support allowing you to contact the manufacturer via email phone and live chat Free programs generally leave you fending for yourself with user manuals or a knowledgebase in which you have to comb through information before you find helpful material specific to you 

    Each tier of PC virus protection lends itself to different users in different situations Here are a few of the main components found in antivirus suites that you wont find in entrylevel antivirus software 

    Antivirus Software As stated above antivirus software is the entrylevel version of virus protection for your PC That is not to say this software is ineffective as it can protect your personal computer from even the most vicious viruses In fact all antivirus software includes tools to block or remove spyware worms rootkits and other malware types Rather this particular set of virus protection software has fewer features than the two antivirus suites This software does include the ability to scan incoming email for potential threats automatically clean or quarantine infected files and create bootable rescue disks to name a few of its many features 

    Internet Security Suites Internet security suites generally contain all of the tools found in entrylevel antispyware such as antimalware PC tuneup utilities safe online banking and shopping secure browsing vulnerability scanning and privacy protection However these suites include additional features that add more levels of security and protection to your computer system Most internet security suites include an alternate firewall from the one included with the Windows operating system and many even offer social network protection designed to detect threats through your online social presence Additionally these antivirus suites include parental controls to limit where your children go while on the internet which can protect the computer system and more importantly your children 

    Premium Security Suites Although the additional protections found in internet security suites are highly valuable premium security suites offer even more protection Just as internet security suites contain all of the features found in antivirus software premium suites include all of the features found in internet suites These programs add extra layers of protection in the form of file shredders online backup system tuneup utilities and password managers In other words these suites tend to be the best of the best offering an entire arsenal of defenses and protection against malware 

    With the different tiers of computer antivirus software demystified you can determine the level of security you require and apply that to your particular situation Although they arent the best or most comprehensive programs free antivirus software allows you to scan and remove threats on your computer for the most part However free software lacks the functionality features and overall support that is readily available on paid programs Entrylevel antivirus software provides significant advancements over freeware and its feature set provides enough functionality for many home users Internet security suites provide even more features while premium security suites are the pinnacle of PC protection 

    No matter which antivirus software catches your eye make sure you consider help and support before making your final decision Look for a program that offers 247 access to support through email phone or live chat Regular easy access to support ensures that you can get the help you need whether you have a simple question or your entire computer system crashes and you need immediate help Whether youre looking for protection on your Windows 10 tablet Windows 8 laptop or Windows 7 business computers make sure the software has numerous means of technical support 

    Regardless of what your small business does youve worked hard to build it and keep it moving forward Even if you dont want to purchase antivirus software for your personal computer you should consider antivirus protection for your business computers to ensure that you your employees and your clients are safe from aggressive malware As our computers become more advanced with more meticulous refined technology and software engineering hackers and viruses follow suit and adapt to become more efficient and malicious The last thing you want is to leave a door open for an attack that can affect your entire business in one fell swoop 

    However choosing the right antivirus software for your business may seem like a daunting task and it can be tempting to purchase the most expensive premium programs assuming they meet all of your needs This is not necessarily the case In our lineup of the best small business antivirus software we evaluated the overall performance of each program and compared their features to help you determine which programs can serve your needs As you consider which software is right for your business needs consider the following 

    Licenses  Pricing First if youre running a shop on your own kudos Second a onemanband business doesnt require antivirus software with 20 user licenses to stay up and running On the other hand if you employ a few people who require personal work computers you dont want to purchase licenses for only one or two of the computers Every employee should have their computer protected so that a virus doesnt make its way through an unprotected system and travel from computer to computer within your business 

    Make sure you protect every computer within your business from virus attacks no matter if you have one computer or 20 Also as a small business you want to make sure the software you purchase is affordable Fortunately most antivirus programs are priced similarly to each other so you dont have to worry too much about searching for the best bargain 

    Malware Protection If youre purchasing antivirus software for your small business you want to make sure it performs its most basic function  protecting you from malware  well AVTest put all the software in our antivirus comparison through rigorous tests to determine how effective each program is at detecting wellknown malware and emerging zeroday viruses The very best programs scored 100 percent in both known and emerging malware protection Look for antivirus software with high scores as these programs are capable of defending you and your business against malicious threats 

    Features One of the main elements that separates antivirus software that can serve your business needs from programs that leave you wanting more is the security feature set If your business constantly sends email to external clients look for software that offers email protection a feature that scans incoming email for malware If hardware security is a concern look for programs that are capable of locating lost or stolen mobile devices such as laptops tablets and phones Some programs allow you to lock or wipe the content off laptops remotely which is a great feature that protects you against the theft of proprietary information contained on the laptop 

    Another element to strongly consider is which operating systems the antivirus software can protect Every small business antivirus software program we reviewed is capable of protecting PCs but only some programs can protect Macs or tablets If you need to use Windows or Linux servers make sure the software you purchase is capable of defending these systems from malware 

    Antivirus software is a necessity in todays business world Over 200000 new malware cases appear on a daily basis meaning every single day there are new ways your business is at risk of falling victim to a malware attack A lack of computer security can halt even the strongest businesses in its tracks Even large corporations suffer from malware attacks which always catches the attention of the media Most attacks against corporations are targeted attacks meaning a person or group of people is specifically trying to harm that entity via malware Fortunately for you most small businesses are only at risk for untargeted threats The best way to protect your small business from hacking or malicious viruses is to find the right antivirus software for your company This will allow you to rest easy 

    In July 2015 Microsoft released the latest version of its operating system Windows 10 As mentioned earlier Windows 10 comes with Windows Defender as a builtin antivirus and it offers a decent level of protection until you choose to install a thirdparty antivirus Most Windows 8 antivirus solutions work on Windows 10 so you shouldnt have problems getting the software to work properly AVTest evaluated 20 Windows 10 antivirus products in September and October of 2015 The tests concluded with four products earning perfect scores Bitdefender Kaspersky Norton and Avira 

    With the release of Windows 8 Windows Defender replaced Microsoft Security Essentials as the baseline of malware protection Although Microsoft continually updates and improves upon Windows Defender this security system does not perform as well as thirdparty Windows 8 antivirus programs According to the German software test lab AVTest the products we reviewed performed rather well compared to Defender demonstrating unusual strengths in intercepting malware while not being too strenuous on the overall system performance 

    Performance The tests Windows 8 antivirus software underwent are broken into two categories zeroday new threats and widespread known threats The industryaverage detection rating of brandnew viruses is 97 percent This means that thirdparty antivirus software is capable of catching most and in some cases all of these new and unknown viruses which is amazing 

    Defender however only averaged 73percent detection which is significantly lower than the industry standard During the tests against widespread and known malware thirdparty programs were capable of detecting 99 percent of all the viruses sent their way while Defender was only capable of detecting 74 percent of these viruses What this means is the very best virus protection for Windows 8 is found in the software we reviewed rather than Windows Defender The ability to detect malware is the most important component for any antivirus program so performance was highly weighted in our ranking process 

    Another element to consider when looking for the best antimalware software is how impactful each program is on your computer AVTest measured the effects each program had on Windows 8 during visits to websites and downloads through these tests they found the industry average was three seconds The very best antivirus software for Windows 8 had no effect on the overall system performance while Windows Defender slowed the system by five seconds 

    However Defender performed better than any other antivirus program when it came to false labeling of nonthreatening files as malicious viruses This is in part due to the fact that Defender takes slightly longer and uses more resources During a test of 525920 safe file samples Defender only mislabeled one sample as a threat The industry average for false labeling is six detections according to AVTests results Although Defender does a great job identifying safe samples it doesnt make up for the fact that it misses a higher percentage of unsafe samples 

    Features Every single program we considered for Windows 8 is capable of detecting spyware worms Trojans rootkits and other types of malware All of them are also capable of scanning incoming email and even instant messages for potential threats both of which are major mediums of attack for virus bots and hackers Additionally every single program we considered can automatically clean infected files without any required action from you as well as store infected files in a quarantine so that they do not infect your entire system Although every program is capable of performing all of these functions there are a number of defining factors for you to consider in order to find the right software for your needs 

    For example only a few antivirus programs for Windows 8 are capable of creating a rescue disk that allows you to reboot a computer that has crashed because of an infection Good antivirus software for Windows 8 automatically scans connected USB storage devices such as flash drives to help defend your computer from attacks Some antivirus software even includes password managers which help you create and store strong passwords These capabilities define the toprated antivirus programs on the market 

    Based on our evaluations of the best antivirus software for Windows 8 we found that Bitdefender Kaspersky and Norton achieved the best AVTest results and have plenty of features to cover your security needs All three of these programs scored 100 percent for the ability to protect against brandnew and old established malware which is impressive Bitdefender and Kaspersky were also scored 100 percent in tests that measure system impact and falsepositive detections meaning they wont slow down your overall computer performance at all and the programs wont mislabel safe files as potential threats Overall these three programs achieve great test results and have full feature sets to protect you against virus attacks 

    Although the computer protections set in place by Microsoft may tempt you to avoid purchasing thirdparty antivirus software you should know that these protections are best used as a starting point Even though Microsoft continually improves upon its builtin security systems with each installment of Windows builtin security getting better and better thirdparty applications simply outperform Microsoft Security Essentials These builtin protections are designed for users who either try to get by without additional security software or dont realize other software is needed However narrowing down the best antivirus for Windows 7 for your needs can seem like a daunting process We evaluated the top performers and ranked them based on their strengths and weaknesses to help you determine the right program for you 

    Performance Of course the most important thing to consider when you search for the right security software is its ability to defend your computer against attacks AVTest a wellrespected independent test lab tested every product we reviewed and published their findings This lab evaluated the protection capabilities of each product by testing it against both brandnew threats and wellknown established malware By exposing hundreds of workstations networked to dozens of servers to tens of millions of threats AVTest is capable of determining which programs can keep your system safe quite accurately Therefore the performance of each Windows 7 antivirus software was the most important element we used to determine our antivirus ratings 

    Features The next thing we considered for Windows 7 antivirus protection was the softwares feature set Generally speaking the more features an antivirus program has the more you can customize the security level of your computer system All antivirus software for Windows 7 is capable of detecting the different types of malware including Trojans spyware worms and rootkits and they can all automatically clean infected files scan compressed files and quarantine threats Differences between these products emerge in the form of more advanced features including the ability to protect computers from attacks that occur when you turn the computer on registry startup create bootable rescue disks and scan USB storage devices While you hunt for the right Windows 7 virus protection look for software that includes a number of additional features that can help you protect your system from nasty viruses 

    Although Microsoft Security Essentials offers some protection for your Windows 7 computer even the least effective thirdparty antivirus programs outperform the builtin security protections Microsoft Security Essentials is best used as a temporary line of defense while you find the antivirus software that will serve your needs best We found that Bitdefender Kaspersky and Norton were the best options for Windows 7 antivirus protection 

    The main goal behind the creation of Windows Vista was to improve the security of the Windows operating system after criticisms of its predecessors security vulnerabilities Despite the security improvements developed specifically for Vista advanced malware was created to break or circumnavigate the security systems in place 

    Even though Microsoft designed Vista with the intent to make it inherently secure thirdparty antispyware software is the best measure against attack from malware The best Windows Vista antivirus software allows you to rest easy and know that your system is safe from potential threats However finding the right Vista antivirus program can be a tricky and difficult process We evaluated and narrowed down the top choices through the following criteria to help keep your system safe 

    Performance All Windows Vista security programs are capable of detecting different types of malware including basic viruses and aggressive rootkits The main difference between these products is not if they can find and remove malware but how good they are at detecting these threats AVTest an independent antivirus test lab evaluates the best antivirus software programs on the market and runs them through rigorous tests to determine each programs ability to detect both brandnew and older malware So while youre looking for the best Vista antivirus software check out the performance scores of each program to make sure it is capable of catching brandnew threats as well as established malware The best software is capable of scoring 99 or even 100 percent in protection so pay special attention to these programs 

    Features All the antivirus software we reviewed for Windows Vista offers email protection automatically cleans infected files scans instant messages and quarantines dangerous files so they cant spread to other files However only some of these programs can create bootable rescue disks that allow you to recover a computer that has been infected which can be incredibly helpful Additionally not every program protects against attacks via USB storage devices or has antiphishing securities in place Make sure to look for programs that meet all of your needs before making your final decision 

    Another element to consider when looking for antivirus software is how impactful the program is on the host operating system The top antivirus programs have no impact on the system performance meaning you can visit webpages download files use different applications and so on without any performance interference from the antimalware program However most programs have at least some effect on the systems performance generally a slowdown of around three seconds which isnt terrible but is still noticeable 

    Even with enhanced security in place with Windows Vista antivirus software allows you to rest easy This software can give you all the protection you need As new malware appears every single day antivirus software evolves to help you stay on top of these growing threats Antivirus software for Windows Vista will help your system remain safe against these constant and everchanging threats 

    Windows XP was a revolutionary operating system for Microsoft that generated an overwhelming level of popularity from the general public and businesses alike XP proved to be intuitive highly capable and the most popular operating system from Microsoft for about 10 years even after the release of Windows Vista and 7 Now that Microsoft has ceased updating support and security updates to Windows XP protection against malware is vital if you want your computer to continue running smoothly Without Windows XP antivirus software you are at higher risk than most users and your computer can become completely unusable in a short period of time To help you narrow down the best antivirus software for your needs we ranked the top 10 antivirus software based on the following criteria 

    Performance The first thing to consider for any antivirus software is its capability to detect and remove malware Not all programs are created equal and some software is better at defending your system against potential threats AVTest an independent software test lab evaluates antivirus software for Windows XP on the effectiveness or in some cases the ineffectiveness of virus protection programs on the market today 

    The very best antivirus software is capable of detecting and removing 100 percent of the threats sent its way Many programs perform decently catching 96 or 97 percent of the malware AVTest sends its way Regardless make sure the antivirus software you purchase for Windows XP can catch and remove a high percentage of threats so you know your system is safe 

    System Usage The next great differentiator between Windows XP virus protection programs comes down to how systemintensive the software is on your computer If you still run Windows XP a major factor in your decision will be the power of your processor If you have a relatively new computer with decent specs you can purchase virtually any antivirus software on the market without having to worry about system performance However if you are looking for antivirus software for an older machine the processing power required to run antimalware programs effectively can be a concern If you have limited RAM or processing speed consider an antivirus program that doesnt take a large toll on the system 

    Regardless of whether your Windows XP hardware is relatively new or rather old its still a good idea to look for programs that are not as resourceintensive during updates scans or malware removal just to be safe Generally speaking the older your computer gets the more ineffective it will be at running new software such as antivirus software which is constantly updating 

    To help you determine whether or not an antivirus program is capable of running on your computer or not weve included the minimum system requirements of Windows XP antivirus software to help you find a program that will work on your machine 

    Features Every program we evaluated is capable of detecting numerous types of malware including spyware rootkits and basic viruses What separates the best antivirus software from the others are additional features that offer more protective techniques to combat malware attacks For example many programs offer the ability to create a backup recovery disk so that you can recover your computer after it has been infected 

    Other programs are capable of performing vulnerability scans in which the antimalware program searches for outdated programs on your computer to see if it can find any weaknesses for malware to pass through Finally the best antivirus software for Windows XP can launch a virtual browser allowing you to run websites separate from your computer system to check it for vulnerabilities You may not need all of these features for your personal use but make sure the software you purchase can handle all of your needs 

    Once upon a time Apple even used the lack of viruses as a marketing tool to sell more Macs In a company marketing web page titled Why Youll Love a Mac no longer exists the language was once quite clear Apples OS X doesnt get PC viruses Somewhere around 2012 that message changed to Its built to be safe The update itself happened shortly after nearly 600000 Macs were infected with a trojan named Flashback and although this wasnt the first time Macs were targeted it was certainly the largest This security breach led Apple and Mac users to understand that they were in no means immune to viruses or malware 

    While large scale viruses are still a rarity among Mac users that doesnt lessen the need for smart antivirus software in order to help you recognize and react to possible infections Here are five smart and free choices to keep your machine free from viruses and malware 

    Sophos Antivirus features an easy to use interface that can be used for custom ondemand scanning as well as fully automated scans at userdefined intervals The software runs quietly in the background and is surprisingly resource friendly so it doesnt slow down your system as much as some other options With the Live Antivirus feature Sophos even updates your software the moment that new threats are found online and through use of the link scanner its now possible to perform full scans on web pages before you click the link to visit 

    In a headtohead test of several popular free and paid options for Mac Sophos was the clear cut winner and one of only two to achieve a perfect 100percent in catching all malware it was tested against with zero false positives 

    Avast is widely considered the best or near the top in terms of free Windows antivirus software For the Mac the system certainly doesnt disappoint and its definitely on par with the top choice Sophos The one major drawback to Avast on Mac is that it only scans for Macspecific malware which is fine if you never use a Windowsbased PC but becomes problematic in terms of email and file sharing when youre sharing these files outside of a Macbased ecosystem As far as security on a Mac though Avast is about as good as they come In fact AV Comparatives tested Avast and found that it detected 100percent of the malware that they attempted to download to the system which makes it the only other Mac antivirus software with that distinction Sophos is the other 

    ClamXav 2 uses the open source ClamAV virus scanning engine to scan for both Windows and OS X malware viruses and badware ClamXav is actually the most lightweight free antivirus software in our recommendations and its compatible with any Mac running OS X 105 or higher 

    Comodo is an extremely powerful antivirus software but its strongest point also makes it a relatively unpopular option outside of the website administrator crowd While its scoring on malware blocking tests and built in sandbox for opening packages and files from unknown sources makes it a very safe and secure utility the nuts and bolts of the program are decidedly expertonly and better left to those who really know that theyre doing 

    As far as an outofthebox option Comodo is powerful but it had relatively poor scores in blocking malicious URLs the rate of false positives is high identifying safe software as malware and the previously mentioned sandbox tool makes it a real pain to install some legit software For example when installing Sketch 3 I had a heck of a time getting the antivirus to understand that the package was safe and that I did indeed want to move it to my Applications folder 

    Avira is a utility that was once according to AV Comparative testing on par with Sophos and Avast in the sense that it caught 100percent of malware tested In the latest test it caught 91percent making it an admirable contender but putting it in the decidedly second tier category of some lesserknowns such as ClamXav 2 That said Avira is by far the most user friendly of any of the antivirus programs tested and it would make a perfect addition for the nontech demographic such as your parents or grandparents 

    As far as what that means for you well it really depends on what youre looking for Each application offers different benefits so your best bet is to determine what type of user you are and begin testing the options from there

Actually this is my first time to use by my own self but avira is also my anti virus before but shamed to say that my comp is always taking care of my EX his the one who do it for all my comp or More    ClamWin Free Antivirus for 2012 build 0973 is designed for Windows and uses the open source GNU General Public License The antivirus program currently supports the following operating systems Microsoft Windows 98 ME XP 2003 and Vista 

    The features you can expect to find in ClamWin Free AntiVirus 2012 are virus database updates which the program retrieves automatically rightclick menu MS Windows Explorer integration scanning scheduler a standalone virus scanner and addin function to MS Outlook which enables easy scanning of email attachments New for 2012 is its Quarantine Browser which offers the option to restore quarantined files later proven to be a false positive a verification process for digital signatures to minimize false positives along with several known bug fixes and protection enhancements  

    One of the downsides to ClamWin Free AntiVirus is that it doesnt have an automatic scanning feature for newly activated files This means that youll have to manually scan all the files you have recently downloaded from the web before you can safely execute or use the files 

    What ClamWin Free AntiVirus does have however is an update feature that ensures that your software application is equipped with protection methods to prevent your computer from getting infected with the latest viruses worms and other types of malware ClamWin Free AntiVirus also has a comprehensive online database that is automatically refreshed several times every 24 hours The new 2012 improves on it virus signature matching at the byte code level signature matching Like most other antivirus programs ClamWin Free AntiVirus also has a scanner scheduler that allows you to customize the exact times of the day when you want your system to be scanned Another cool feature of the ClamWin Free AntiVirus database is its availability in a portable version which users can store and use from a USB universal serial bus flash drive 

    ClamWin Free AntiVirus uses the open source GNU General Public License Because of this the program comes with an open source code and an installer that you also get at no cost ClamWin Free AntiVirus can be installed silently  you can install the software application without interacting directly with the program This means no user prompts no text confirmations and no dialog boxes 

    The downloaded installer allows you to integrate the software with Internet Explorer and also choose to install the Outlook module It then lends an icon on your Windows tray which when rightclicked opens the ClamWin configuration page for scheduling scans manually checking on updates and displaying reports among others  

    ClamWin Free AntiVirus has a graphical user interface that is relatively easy to use The main user interface is downright basic and uncluttered with a simple tree view for choosing your drives and folders to scan But the simplicity betrays an efficiency that is par for the course among free antivirus software Launching Outlook opened ClamWin with it as an addon ribbon that works in the background to detect and identify infected incoming messages You can easily jump from tab to tab to go to the specific function you wish to tweak or execute If you want to conduct more thorough scans you can use the rightclick feature to select the specific files directories and locations that you want to scan 

    Although ClamWin lacks the ondemand scanning option and other uptodate functions found in other free antivirus programs its still a good option for those who want to keep their computers safe from viruses without spending a dime 

    Protecting your PC or Mac from a virus is easy with internet security software  but deciding which package to install isnt We have expert advice on picking out the best antivirus suite and tell you whether free antivirus is worth considering 

    The internet is full of threats but thats no reason not to enjoy the best of the web  the key is keeping your Mac or PC properly protected with an internet security package Viruses and malware can infect your computer in several ways but the best antivirus software will give you peace of mind that your computer and personal data are safe 

    Most people keep their computer safe by buying a security suite which will usually include antivirus antispyware software and a firewall Your security package should cost from 3050 and usually includes a years subscription to software updates to keep it uptodate with details about the latest threats 

    The best security software suites come with extra features such as parental controls maintenance and backup and recovery tools that can help you restore your computer in the event of a disaster Generally they also have better customer and technical support than free internet security 

    Pros Provides an allround antivirus antispyware and firewall solution accessed through a single interface Individual components are automatically updated at the same time so you get protection against the latest threats 

    Cons They can be expensive  from 3050 and youll also face ongoing costs usually in the form of an annual subscription in order to receive updates after the initial period of protection is over usually a year Some security suites can place a huge drain on system resources too potentially slowing down your computers operation 

    Alternatively you can download free antivirus tools from the internet that provide a good level of protection And its possible to get most of the features supplied by paidfor internet security by using a combination of free antivirus downloads though they wont be packaged up neatly in one place and you can risk compatibility problems 

    Pros You can use your chosen antivirus antispyware antispam and firewall programs in tandem to completely protect your PC or Mac without spending a penny And because theyre free you can try out different packages before settling on the one for you 

    Cons They provide only a basic level of protection and lack the extra features of paidfor security software Youll have to keep each individual program updated to ensure youre protected against the latest threats Plus free antivirus software is typically singleuser so youll need to download install and manage a separate version if you have more than one computer 

    The biggest shakeup in PC security for years came with Microsofts launch of Windows 8 Unlike previous versions it came with lots of security features baked right into the operating system and Which found Windows 8 to be very secure in our tests 

    Weve yet to test out Windows 10 security in our test lab but we expect it to include similar security provisions as Windows 8 One of the key changes for Windows 8 was the replacement of Microsoft Security Essentials with Windows Defender Defender has been beefed up to include antivirus protection along with antispyware features It runs in the background and notifies you when you need to take action 

    Windows 8 and 10 users are further protected by a twoway firewall that monitors the information going back and forth to the internet Other features include a SmartScreen filter to help protect against phishing scams plus parental controls to monitor childrens activities online Windows 8 and Windows 10 both include a Secure Boot option that prevents malware from gaining a foothold on your PC during startup 

    Pros We found that Microsoft Windows 8 has strong builtin security and antivirus features and we fully expect Windows 10 to continue this trend Which has found that this means you dont need to use additional security software if youre running Windows 8  well know soon if the same is true on Windows 10 

    Cons Because of the sheer amount of Windows users Microsofts operating system is frequently made the target of hackers and creators of viruses PC users with versions of Windows prior to Windows 8 should certainly seek to install separate security software 

    Despite their reputation for being more secure than Windows PCs Apple Mac computers are not immune from viruses and malware With more Apple products being sold the target audience for hackers is becoming more attractive This makes it more likely that viruses will be designed specifically to attack Macs so it makes sense to think about Mac security software 

    Apple continues to boost security in each new version of the Mac OS X operating system But Macs do not include antivirus or antispyware software although they do have a builtin firewall to block attacks from malicious users online Theres plenty of paidfor and free security software for the Mac to choose from 

    Cons Perhaps due to Apples reputation for being less susceptible to malware there arent a huge amount of security packages available  and those we have tested have on average scored worse than antivirus suites for Windows 

    Theres a long standing adage that using two antivirus products is a bad idea because they can cause glitches with two programs trying to perform the same task Limiting yourself to one internet security program also minimises the impact of AV software on the performance of your PC 

    Pros Weve seen some security software that usefully bolster the malware fighting elements of your main antivirus package Malwarebytes AntiMalware for example is a standalone security tool that can be installed alongside your regular security software  and it has a brilliant track record for vanquishing virtual nasties Plus its free 

     avast is an antivirus set that is able to detect the presence of viruses in computers It has a powerful antivirus kernal that has a boottime scan improved resident protection heuristic analysis for email and a script blocker The program works great as a ondemand andor resident virus scanner The skinable interface is easy to use for any user  

This software used to be better Too many false positives and no support unless you pay Fresh installs of Wordpress are blocked because of HTMLScriptinf Then Avasts asks to upgrade for more protection    It gets a 1 star because it wouldnt let me go to a jailbreak link I know is fine then I uninstalled Avast it tells me to reboot to finish uninstalling only for Windows 8 to refuse to boot up again due to a missing file Now I get to spend hours reinstalling Windows and everything and lost data over it Thanks Avast not I should add if you check the av comparative website Avast has far more false positives than any of the other software they test much higher not just a few files difference 

    Hi guys  newbe here I have been using Avast 48 professional for yonks 481335 expiry 2018 and have found it elstupendo Whats not documented about THIS edition is that when you run Malwarebytes manually it handshakes with avast and they BOTH examine the files Whats annoying lately is that although this is a legal registered and paid for edition I have been getting these daily pop ups from Avast telling me my free edition is about to run out so register now Firstly I dont have a free edition and it IS registered I confirmed this by reregistering it and Avast sez OK carry on The a day later  almost exactly this stupid pop up appears again It has not effected my upgrades nor any functionality at all but it is getting to be a pain having to just close the pop up and ignore it What in the sam hill is causing this to happen AND regularly by time clock every 24 hours no sooner or later
PS my system clock and date is correct 

    The AntiVir Guard is constantly working in the background and checks every file as it is used by Windows or other software This includes heuristic scanning to check for viruses that have not been formally identified 

    Can you imagine your PC or laptop without an anti virus software Of course not When it comes to digital threats like phishing malware and Trojans  theres no better cure than prevention And the best way to avoid attacks is to install the best antivirus for your needs Think of all the dangers we have encountered over the past years these bugs have become so sophisticated they can penetrate complex firewalls break security codes and remain undetected Good thing there are lots of choices for Internet security 

    How to pick Dont panic  our inhouse testers devoted a huge chunk of their time in making sure you get only the finest antivirus reviews From little details to its newest features we leave no stone unturned We want to make it easier for all our readers because weve been there So we know what you care about the most Be it price range pros cons plus overall performance on any platform  here are the top ten best antivirus software to ensure complete digital protection 

    With millions of households affected by malware each year  do you want to be a statistic Each of your devices from your laptop to your mobile phone hold important data From business contacts to treasured videos you wouldnt want to lose any of these information to strangers Antivirus software was designed to guard against attacks and any suspicious threats on your precious gadgets 

    Even when youre not as tech savvy you still need one Think of all your files that you wish to protect Surely youve heard about highprofile individuals and their online accounts getting hacked As a result their private data not only leaked out it also damaged their reputations These cyber attacks dont just harm digital documents  they can cause immeasurable distress on those affected 

    Thats why our experts pride themselves in bringing you updated simple information about the top anti virus software available on the market You might have noticed that the same brands are dominant  but thats only because they have been tried and tested for years To be fair we also included other contenders like Avira Eset and Trend Micro 

     AVG is a big name in AV with its free software offering a basic level of protection We chose to evaluate this over the paidfor software because its the most popular version Internet Security 2015 is the paidfor service and includes additional features that could potentially improve its results including Cloudbased file scanning which analyses files before theyre ever downloaded to your computer 

    Last year we were irritated by AVGs rather overt advertising tactics with banners and popups encouraging us to upgrade The banner is still there ever present in all parts of the software but is far less garish Theres a tool for cleaning junk from your PC The analysis tool is part of the free package but youll need separate paidfor PC TuneUp software in order to solve any issues 

    Protection scores have improved remarkably since our last set of tests with AVG managing an overall score of 93 in our most recent round of tests Unfortunately in a super competitive round of tests 93 puts AVG thirdfromlast and a fair way behind free antivirus leader Avast When subjected to 100 attacks AVG faultlessly defendined against 57 A further 36 were able to run on our test system but AVG neutralised them before they were able to do any damage Slightly worryingly seven threats made it through untouched and were allowed to wreak havoc on our test PC  

    There are plenty of options that at first glance have no explanation but AVG has included an extensive offline help file that can be accessed from any part of the settings menus and youll be taken to the page explaining that particular function Its a useful addition particularly for less experienced users 

    AVG is a great piece of software just slightly let down by its protection scores Considering its taken massive strides in improving its scores however we wouldnt be surprised if it became a front runner in future tests For now though wed recommend Avast Free Anti Virus as your top choice of free protection 

    Today an antivirus is a must install piece of software to protect your computer against online threats Although there are no antivirus applications that can guarantee 100 protection all the time it can offer a high level of protection up to more than 90 depending on the type of antivirus software that you use There are quite a few brands that develop antivirus software and they dont all have the same capability It is generally safe to say that a good antivirus is one that is most being used such as AVAST which is currently the most downloaded software in CNETs Downloadcom followed by AVG 

    Well be taking a look at a lesser known piece of antivirus software called FortiClient developed by Fortinet a company that specializes in network security hardware products There used to be 2 different versions of FortiClient which is the paid Standard and the free Lite version However in the current version 5 theyve dropped the different versions and made the single FortiClient free 

    Basically the main features found in FortiClient are the real time antivirus with advanced heuristics a web security module which protects you against certain types of websites by category and a VPN Remote Access which is mostly not used by home users adsbygoogle  windowadsbygoogle  push The firewall module has been dropped from FortiClient 

    FortiClient has been consistently awarded from AVComparatives since 2012 and they recently received an ADVANCED which is the highest rating in the file detection test Other than that FortiClient successfully blocked 99 on the April 2015 realworld protection test beating other popular competitors such as AVG BullGuard Emsisoft Lavasoft McAfee Quick Heal Sophos and Vipre 

    VB100 is the most well known comparison test performed by Virus Bulletin FortiClient has earned 9 out of 10 VB100 award in the last 12 tests with 2 tests not entered In fact the full test history shows very clearly that FortiClient did quite badly in the beginning and it got better with only 2 fail out of 22 tests since June 2010 

    PCSL is a company from China consisting of a team of passionate testers and researchers They have conducted many different types of tests such as cleaning test android malware detection test desktop browser performance review exploit mitigations test and etc 

    The Desktop Malware Detection Test conducted on December 2014 has FortiClient included in the report and it achieved 2nd place with 99903 detection and 0 false positives missing merely 20 samples out of 20552 

    A summary of 5 enterprise products being tested by NSS Labs dated back in 2014 shows that FortiClient successfully achieved a 998 block rate with 994 blocked on download and 04 blocked on execution This figure puts FortiClient in the 2nd place in par with Bitdefender while the first place is taken by Symantec 

    Weve also performed a very simple and quick test to see the effectiveness of FortiClient in blockingdetecting new malware samples Weve downloaded 10 latest samples from VX Vault and FortiClient instantly detected 6 out of 10 As for the remaining 4 samples they were successfully blocked from downloading to the computer by the Web Security module 

    The second major feature found in FortiClient that makes it even better is the Web Security module which acts as a web filter It has 6 different main site categories and each category expands to a more specific type of websites 

    You can easily change the configuration either to allow block warn or monitor by clicking on the icon and select the appropriate command A specific website can be added to the exclusion list if there is a need to access it but is in a blocked category 

    There is not much configuration found in FortiClient and most settings can be left at the default There is a backuprestore configuration logging enabling VPN before logon using local certificate uploads enabling detection for programs that belong in the grayware category such as an Adware and Riskware and etc Do take note that the Enable WAN Optimization option will only work if you are connected to a network with a FortiGate device configured for WAN optimization Most of the time this option is not needed at home 

    Another useful feature is the ability to lock FortiClient with a password to prevent from pausing the protection or closing the program The settings are also protected and cannot be changed when the configuration changes is locked 

    With a quick glance in terms of performance FortiClient creates 9 background processes and taking up less than 20MB of memory usage on Windows startup The memory usage does not increase much when the computer is idle and only goes up when there is activity such as scanning a file A slightly dated performance test by AVComparatives shows that FortiClient offers better performance than the out of box system impact with Microsoft Windows Defender enabled on Windows 81 

    Closing Words FortiClient offers very good protection against malicious software and a superior web filter for free The only thing is we couldnt get confirmation from Fortinet if the free FortiClient can be used commercially FortiClient is definitely a good alternative to other free antivirus software such as Avast AVG Avira etc 

    As I just said in a comment under your List of Free Antivirus for Commercial Use it can based on what a Fortinet guy said in their forum For the record I am not affiliated with Fortinet in any way I am a SOHO user looking for a free AV for a couple of my PCs and thats how I found your site and then Fortinet forum 

    When it comes to free antivirus for Windows computer your friends will mostly recommend you either Avast Free Antivirus 2015 or AVG AntiVirus FREE 2016 But which one of them is the best Both are completely for free and offers plenty of advanced feature Well take a look in details 

    Both Avast and AVG are offering a solid protection against viruses spyware malware and rootkids Plus you will be secured while browsing online chatting on Facebook or watching videos on YouTube Also they will protect and scan your incoming and outgoing emails if you are using email client like Outlook or Thunderbird If youre a gamer you can relax  both antivirus solutions offers smart gaming mode and keep themselves silent 

    With Avast you will get some cool features like Home Network Security which scans your home network WiFi connection and routers Easytouse tool called Browser Cleanup for removing unwanted toolbars from your browser Software Updater for monitoring the uptodate status of the other software like browser Java Adobe Reader etc And you can ask your IT friend to fix your computer via the secured remote connection 

    However there are some differences AVG offers spying and data theft protection controlling what kind of data you are sharing with the other applications and File Shredder which can permanently delete your sensitive information so they cant be restored Similar feature called Data Shredder is available also in Avast but only in the toptier product Avast Premier not in the free one 

    Big plus for AVG is that you dont need to register or give out any personal information You can just download install and keep using it With Avast you have to register name and email within the first 30 days and then once a year 

    In the boot time test where less is better it took only 28 seconds in average to load Windows desktop when Avast Free Antivirus was installed Same operation took 33 seconds in average when AVG AntiVirus FREE was installed Default boottime without any antivirus solution in place took 20 seconds So according to our testing Windows loads faster with Avast 

    Final performance test results are highlighted on the chart below You can clearly see the difference between no antivirus and Avast or AVG present Please note the vertical axis Performance Score is not starting from 0 but from 2110 to clearly show the small differences 

    Avast user interface is really nice and clear The main four tiles shows the the most popular tools which you can run on a singleclick You can also change the tiles and select what featuresscans you want to list on the main page The green button UPGRADE leads to comparison table of Avast Free Antivirus and Avast premium products 

    The status is also indicated by color when green obviously means You are protected note AVG is using the exactly same term Also you are assured that All shields are active and Everything is uptodate The menu on the left side on the other hand could be more easier to read and contain less items Items like Store Account and Statistics are rather additional and not that important 

    AVG user interface is quite busy compared to Avast When everything is fine you will see green tick marks with the message You are protected The interface will go red if there will be some issue What is nice is when some of the shields are disabled you will see immediately which ones as they will also turn in red 

    The main tiles shows you the status of the specific shield protection If you are looking for scan its the less visible button Scan now The Fix performance button sounds pretty interesting but you need to download other product AVG PC TuneUp to actually fix the performance Last button is for checking if the program is uptodate of course the virus definitions are updated automatically Join us on Facebook link at the top bar is very visible and somehow distracting

    The better product is the most users it has Its simple as that However its not easy to say which is most popular antivirus if Avast or AVG For expressing popularity we are using several publicly accessible methods 

    According to official website Avast is protecting more than 230 million users worldwide AVG claims on their homepage to have more than 200 million users worldwide in November 2015 Based on these reliable claims Avast has more users than AVG 

    OPSWAT is regularly releasing reports about the antivirus market share Data are based on the OPSWAT GEARS software installed on the client machines According to the latest report from January 2015 Avast is dominating the worldwide market with 214 Closely followed by Microsoft with their Security Essentials and 194 AVG is at the third place with only 86 

    Downloadcom by CNET is the Worlds most popular download portal According to its popularity rankings AVG has more total downloads  almost 539 million while Avast has only 347 million However the recent trend shows Avast is slightly more popular as it leads the last week downloads number 

    Another way how to measure productcompany popularity is by the number of fansfollowers on social media networks like Facebook and Twitter Avast is leading on Facebook with almost 44 million fans vs AVGs 32 million On Twitter the leader is AVG with 220k followers vs Avasts 161k 

    Respected computer magazine PCMag gives AVG AntiVirus FREE better rating than Avast Free Antivirus in their comprehensive comparison of free antivirus solutions Actually AVG is their choice 1 with 455 rating and Editors Choice award 

    Both products will run on majority of todays computers as there are no special requirements You just need to run a newer Windows than 2000 so at least Windows XP with Service Pack 2 Both Avast and AVG are also fully compatible with the latest Windows 10 

    Although the requirements are very similar there are some small differences Avast will run on a slower computer Intel Pentium III with 128 MB RAM but needs quite a lot of space on hard drive 2 GB AVG needs faster computer Intel Pentium 15 GHz with 512 MB RAM but takes less space on hard drive 12 GB 

    Both products have their pros and cons We dont want to recommend only one of them instead we would like to encourage you to try both and see if Avast or AVG will suit you better Even they are offered completely for free the level of protection you will get is comparable with the paidfor antivirus solutions The download links are below 

    Information about the product features have been obtained from the official websites of each vendor If you believe we have stated something not correct please let us know and well fix it immediately Our intention is to offer the fair and factbased comparison of each product

 If youre going to stay safe out there on the internet a good reliable antivirus utility is Read more Read more     We immediately nixed some contenders we knew would come up namely nothing OS XLinux and Microsoft Security Essentials for a few reasons First nothing and OS XLinux dont really help anyone and only serve to stoke a debate that no one willor is interested in trying toresolve Weve already explained why you should use antivirus even if you browse carefully and explained that your security has to do with more than just your activities Second MSE while it used to be a great tool is no longer at the top of its game and even Microsoft says its not built to offer the same protection as thirdparty antivirus rather they want it to be a good enough tool instead  

 The best way to avoid viruses is to use common sense but that doesnt mean you should avoid Read more Read more     Avast Free Antivirus is our current pick as the best antivirus for Windows but it remains to be seen whether itll be your pick as well Its come a long way in a few short updates with the 2014 version offering a streamlined easy to navigate interface and a plethora of onaccess scanning and protection tools some of which you may not want so take care when installing Its still one of the top picks available according to AV Comparitives and AVTest and performs well in antivirus tests Avast offers an onaccess antivirus scanner that examines files downloaded pages you visit emails you receive and any files downloaded and also features an ondemand scanner you can run at any time It updates quietly in the background without fuss and has a silent mode where you can disable any and all notifications and warnings to keep performance slim and trim The app itself is relatively resource lightyou may not even notice its there Best of all its completely free 

 Windows has more antivirus programs than we can count and none of them are quite perfect Right Read more Read more     In the nominations round many of you praised Avast for its performance and light use of system resources and others pointed out that youd been Avast users for a long time and were pleased to see its updates Others highlighted specific features like Avasts screensaver scan where the application only kicks in when youre away from the computer or the system is idle A few of you even highlighted the fact that Avast is crossplatform and available for multiple operating systems Its not perfect by any means but its a great tool You can read more in its nominations thread here 

    ESETs NOD32 Antivirus suite has been popular for years and has earned a reputation for offering complete onaccess and ondemand protection while being extremely lightweight when it comes to system resources If you thought youd have to balance performance with protection NOD32 has consistently proven you dont The most recent version of NOD32 includes more than just antivirus protection howeveryou also get antimalware scanning phishing protection antispyware protection and even special tools to make sure you dont fall for scams and hacks on social networks like Facebook and Twitter AV Comparatives still loves it and while its not free itll starts at 40yr it does offer premium protection to match its price tag If youre looking for even more protection its worth stepping up to the pricierbutmorerobust ESET Smart Security which earned its own praise in the nominations round It also offers antitheft protection for your devices advanced tools and scanning options multidevice management tools a silent gaming mode thats somehow lighter on resources parental controls and more Itll set you back 60yr  

    The nomination threads for both products were full of praise with almost everyone highlighting how well both tools performed both in virus detection and removal tasks as well as in everyday use when you didnt want to notice it Franklythat is the test of a great antivirus tool When youre doing nothing you dont want to notice it running and ESETs tools both provide that kind of resourcelight computing experience Those of you who nominated NOD32 highlighted its fireandforget features that dont need a lot of tinkering but those of you who highlighted ESET Smart Security highlighted its advanced tools and options that give you incredible control over the tool Read more in NOD32s nomination thread here or Smart Securitys nomination thread here  

    BitDefender prides itself on offering a oneclick antivirus and security tool for people who both need to be able to get their hands dirty when they want to as well as people who just need a simple tool that runs and keeps them protected from threats without a ton of tweaking Whether you go for the paid or the free version BitDefenders minimal interface and lightweight install earned the praise of the folks at AV Comparatives BitDefenders Internet Security 80 suite comes with a firewall parental controls and other useful tools to keep your systemand presumably all of its userssafe If youre looking for something lighter to keep your machine safe without all the bells and whistles BitDefender Free wont cost you a cent and gets the job done In fact if you were a fan of MSEs simple install and silent protection BitDefender Free is very close to that experience without a ton of options tweaks or toggles Just simple security for your PC 

    Those of you who praised BitDefender in the nominations thread praised the completeness of the Internet Security suite but particularly highlighted the free version and its setitandforgetit protection Its simpleas in some advanced users who like features like silent mode or additional ondemand malware protection may find it lacking but for those people who just want to make sure nothing gets past their eyes without being properly inspected its a simple option that you download install turn on and forget about Its even crossplatform Read more in its nomination thread here 

    Kaspersky Antivirus is a bit of a controversial entry It earns extremely high praise in some quarters and revulsion in others For their part AV Comparatives gave it their product of the year award which counts for a lot in our book Kaspersky boasts rapid updates strong heuristics and the ability to quickly adapt to new threats without needing entire product updates to keep you protected Its a fullyfeatured antivirus tool that offers both onaccess and ondemand scanning of files emails downloads and executed applications Kaspersky promises that their smaller more regular updates will help protect your PC from known threats but also keep you safe from OS exploits and holes in software you may not have been able to update or patch yet The tool also comes with a resourcelight gaming mode that will let you play in peace antiphishing protection and more Its a premium product and starts at 40yr  

    Kasperskys nominations thread was full of the backandforth we mentioned earlier Some of you praised it for being complete and wellrounded and taking a proactive approach to internet security Others noted that its one of the more heavy products in the roundup and felt bloated and slow on your computer Unlike many of the other contenders Kaspersky makes no lofty claims about its resource utilization or lightweight install However it does offer complete protection from threats and depending on what you use your PC for that may be more important Read more in its nomination thread here  

    Avira is another tool that ranked among the top of AV Comparatives list of great antivirus tools as well as AVTests rankings and offers a suite of features beyond traditional onaccess and ondemand scanning completely for free It also offers antimalware protection antispyware protection and browser protection Its not brimming with features but the important ones are there and they perform well Avira also prides itself on its cloudbased scanning meaning instead of waiting for updates to the application the program can upload suspicious files to Avira for scanning against more recent threats  

    Avira earned some solid praise in the nominations thread with a few people noting theyve used it for ages back when it was called Avira AntiVir without issue and the general note being that if you want something a bit more complicated than BitDefender but dont care for Avast for some reason this is a great bet Like many others on the list its also crossplatform and if you upgrade to the paid version you get even more features Read more in its nomination thread here  

    The honorable mentions this week go out to Comodo Internet Security Comodo Internet Security earned high praise in the nominations round from those of you familiar with Comodos strong firewall product and you pointed out that Comodo Internet Security is the full package of their productsa great onaccess scanner and antivirus utility along with an ondemand malware scanner and a firewall should you need one Its fast flexible and its freeyou dont have to spend a ton of money to get onaccess scanning or regular updates and Comodo even offers a guarantee that you wont get infected while running their product or they owe you 500

    I decided to try this one the Free version after having constant problems with Avast 8 not initializing the GUI on bootup or showing nonexistent shield errors and conflicting with Thunderbird you cant send mail because of an error of Avast mail shield and i must say that im surprised with Pandas efficiency and amazing light footprint on your system Cpu  Ram AVcomparativesorg reports give it a 977 detection rate which is right up with some major names Also you dont have to worry about daily updates or anything else Due to its cloud nature its constantly updated and also wont give you false positives It also scans your system in the background but you wont notice any lags If you want more indepth scans you can complement Panda with the several free AV scanonly like Kaspersky Emsisoft or McAfee and run one of those once a week like i do you also have the excellent MalwareBytes AntiMalware Free to scan for malware and spyware so you dont need to spend money to be protected 

the bottom area where I was supposed to accept or agree to the license terms was cut off I changed all my setting to try and adjust the screen to permit the full window but it wouldnt work

    In our Mac antivirus  internet security software review group test we test and rate six of the best Mac antivirus software suites on the market and help you decide 1 whether your Mac needs antivirus software at all and 2 Which Mac antivirus software is the best one for you Read on for our complete guide to Mac security and virus protection 

    Somewhere between these two statements lies the truth Macs are not immune to cyber attack and assuming that they are is a dangerous game to play But what we do know with certainty is that when compared to the most widely used and exploited computing platforms  Windows for desktop PCs and Android for mobile phones  the Apple Mac has all but evaded the widespread attention of criminals 

    Most malware developers seek to infect and control computers for profit pursuing platforms that are the most popular by number and least secure by design For these reasons Mac OS X is still far from top of their todo list 

    And OS X is itself more difficult for cybercriminals to target Its Unixbased for one thing and Unix offers a number of security features built in  such as the way that executable code and data is stored in separate folders This is why deleting an app on a Mac is so simple 

    Nevertheless dangerous malware for OS X does exist in limited numbers Its perhaps a sign of quite how limited that when an outbreak of a Mac virus does occur it makes frontpage news on tech sites sometimes its even discussed in international news channels Especially when the victim is a highprofile user such as Google or Apple itself as was disclosed in February 2013 when a Trojan broke these companies defences aided by that old perennial of malware facilitators the crossplatform Java software 

    Whether malwaredetection software was used at Apple and Google campuses we do not know but targeted attacks at gateway individuals will typically use malware that is not currently on any AV antivirus firms blacklist or use zeroday exploits in the PC operating system or indeed any application running on it 

    Sadly for Mac users everywhere the widespread adoption of Apples desktop computing platform by keenly targeted companies like Google  which has migrated away from Windows almost entirely after a wave of spearphishing attacks in 2009  means that criminal and staterun hackers will be honing their techniques specifically against OS X now more than ever 

    Bottom line Despite what some analysts have argued Macs are fundamentally safer from malware and other internet attacks than PCs Architecturally Unixbased OS X is considered more difficult to crack than rival OS platforms but a larger factor is the simple fact that for reasons of market share and riskreward calculations less malware is written to target Macs However there are Mac viruses out there and it would be a mistake to assume that your Mac is completely immune to attack  

    A word about spyware This was a popular form of intrusion on Windows PCs up to around ten years ago but is now rarely discussed or highlighted by antivirus software The reason is that spyware is now more pervasive and used against every internetconnected platform whether laptop or desktop smartphone or tablet Its almost reached respectable status in that many people aware of the problem are hopelessly resigned to its use 

    So now spyware is employed by commercial companies in order to track web users through more insidious processes than just installing a secret exe on your PC Spying and tracking your computer use is now standard operational procedure for social networks and thousands of webanalytics startups all focused on reading and writing your browser cookies your Flash cookies hiding invisible tracking pixels and deploying assorted JavaScript tricks triggered for example by clicking Like or 1 buttons 

    To reduce the effects of privacyinvading web tracking spyware on your Mac requires a different strategy than installing antivirus software Good starting points would be to use Ghostery or Disconnect browser plugins with a cookie manager such as Sweet P Cookie 

    Similarly if youre turning to security software for your Mac to help combat remote surveillance of you be sure to ask how an antivirus company is treating your data Most antivirus programs are reasonably upfront in acknowledging that they will  usually with your optin consent  check every web page you visit harvest suspect files from your computer for their own analysis and collect what they deem suspicious emails including their contents 

    Such data mining is more prevalent in free software where the developer can recoup their investment by using you the user to harvest more data on their behalf But even paidfor AV software will have some form of user community or customer feedback system which collects data from you 

    We assembled a group of six Mac malwaredetection suites half available to download for free half based on the traditional yearly subscription model The former group carry the usual caveat about free products whereby you may be paying through other means sometimes agreeing to have your web use monitored or to having your files uploaded to the vendor 

    Ideally antivirus software should detect and remove where necessary each and every piece of malware that comes close to your computer It should do so without ever making the mistake of wrongly identifying innocent files as malware It should do so transparently enough that you are not disturbed by notifications that its just updated itself or needs registering or in other ways needlessly tries to grab your attention And finally it should not slow down your computer in any way while it is operating silently in the background 

    To ascertain the most important aspect of actually stopping and detecting malware we turned to Mac antimalware specialist Security Spread a website that publishes full lab tests of antivirus software for OS X We used the results of its last roundup in April 2014 including an applications ability to detect over 400 strains of real malware installers installed malware traces and propensity to falsely accuse innocent software of evil intent 

    We also looked at the impact of running security software on your Mac which may be far more debilitating than is commonly realised Some tasks took a worrying 14 times longer with realtime scanning enabled 

    We looked at six of the best Mac antivirus  allround security suites on the market right now Below are summaries of our reviews but click through to read the full review and see all our detailed test results 

    Avast Free Antivirus for Mac 80 is free and offers decent malware protection Avast could make a good fallback for monitoring known Mac malware although our tests suggest it can slow your Mac to a crawl in daily activities when simply running in the background 

    Avira for Mac is a capable antivirus software suite that didnt cause as much of a slowdown on our test Macs as other suites here Plus the German and familyowned company doesnt currently seem to subsidise its freemium business model by selling user data 

ClamXav2 works well and is regularly updated by its volunteer developer It was the slowest antivirus suite in its scans but has no realtime scanner component to slow down daytoday work on your Mac    Kasperskys Internet Security for Mac software offers reasonable performance but tended to be a little unstable Nevertheless it proved relatively capable in our malwareprotection benchmarks There are better alternatives 

    Do you need to run a fulltime virus scanner on your Mac The answer for most users today is still probably no although there are people and organisations for whom the added level of security is worthwhile  financial institutions cautious corporations along with security researchers trawling the webs underbelly 

    Running antivirus all the time in the background can have a remarkable effect in slowing down your Macs performance so you may like to consider running regular system scans when youre not using the machine and disabling realtime protection at times when you dont want to wait ten times longer than normal for some tasks to complete 

    Of the paidfor antivirus software packages we reviewed Kaspersky Labs latest was perhaps the most disappointing The company has a good pedigree in chasing down Windows malware and the product has improved since this user last tested five years ago But it still proved a little unstable at times Its file fingerprinting could help mitigate against slow repeated scanning of the same directory although this may be of little benefit if the results are not cached between launches 

    ESET appealed to our tweakhappy side giving many options for finetuning the application to balance malwareseeking efficacy against resource hogging and false positives Even tested with default settings it showed some of the least intrusive impact on Mac processor use It also features an easy but effective external volume utility that can block most usual data ports or warn on USB thumbdrive insertion for example The company has obviously put a lot of time into designing and developing its Cyber Security software for Mac users and supports it well In malware detection terms its a few down from the top but like most will likely keep you safe from 9 out of 10 known Mac threats 

    If you want antivirus for your Mac that has the best chance of spotting incoming danger the consistently highest scoring solution looks to be Intego VirusBarrier It is also rated best for picking up on nasties that have already distributed themselves around your private areas Now packaged with NetBarrier for the entrylevel Mac Internet Security X8 product the software is also with Kaspersky Internet Security for Mac the most premiumpriced at 40 every year The softwares stability limited resource diversions and ease of use commend it to most potential users of Mac security software 

    It wont have escaped eagleeyed readers attention that the above six Mac antivirus products are not the only ones available to buy While these are the six we focused on in our lab testing here are older reviews of some alternative Mac security suites 

    These may give some guidance as to the general reputation and quality of software produced by rival security firms Bear in mind however that these reviews are a few years old and that the importance and frequency of patches and updates makes it vital to check uptodate reviews of security suites The six antivirus suites reviewed above were all reviewed at the same time under the same conditions and using exactly the same methodology and we would recommend choosing your Mac security software  if you choose to use one  from that list 

    Finally for more information on Mac security take a look at this feature by our colleagues at PC Advisor Do Apple Macs need antivirus OS X security explained and for a general roundup of recent developments in the industry see 5 cool new security research breakthroughs 

    Avira Antivirus Pro includes download scanning browser protection and secure online shopping for 3899year For 5799year you can upgrade to Avira Internet Security Suite which tosses in system speedup utilities like file encryption and cleanup For 7799year you also get a driver updater which identifies and removes corrupt or outdated drivers and helps your machine run at its peak A full feature breakdown is available here 

    In lab tests by Virus Bulletin Avira scores well ahead of ESET Kaspersky and Avast in proactive and reactive protection and fares just as well and in some cases better than Bitdefender AVTest scored Avira 66 across all three fields protection performance and usability AVComparatives ranked Avira fifth in its realworld tests behind Kaspersky and ahead of ESET 

    The main window is a series of toggles for individual features of internet and virus protection Shortcuts to detailed settings for each feature are easily accessible The settings menu though extensive is broken down into sensible subheadings for easy navigation Users can target certain areas and file types via either the preset scan profiles or custommade profiles Scans can also be scheduled for locations and times 

    The firewall included in Avira Antivirus Pro is a nice touch since much of the competing software doesnt include it until premium upper tiers It has options for application rules and behavior in private or public networks Another welcome unique feature is a social network protection plugin for parents All you have to do is connect your account and your kids account and you can get reports on suspicious friends they may be making and receive alerts when sex drugs violence or alcohol are mentioned Email scanning is apparently included but getting it set up can be tricky depending on mail program and ports being used Finally Avira is available on Android with inapp purchases just in case you need track any lost phones 

    Avira is gracious enough to stay out of the browser Other antivirus programs will put little checkmarks next to links they have scanned and deemed secure Avira still scans your web browsing in realtime but if you need visual confirmations while you browse Avira wont have them for you Were thankful that things stay clean in the browser Scan time was a little long clocking in at almost an hour but it managed to catch a few things that other programs hadnt picked up Memory usage was a little on the high side though we didnt bump into any serious performance lags in a multitasking environment 

    Avira Antivirus Pro 2015 offers core security measures that rate very well in the labs A handful of other features like firewall and unobtrusive browser protection are included but the program overall is very simple and straightforward If youre hungry for a whole suite of security features you may want to look elsewhere but for something straightforward and effective Avira does the trick for us 

    Avira has free powerful version too and it doesnt bugs you with notifications all the time not that Avast is doing the same but what i am saying is that Avira Free is a true install and forget antivirus As a long years being AVG beta tester I pretty much know how this things work Choosing Avira free over lifetime AVG Internet Security Premium package means something  

    I used to be huge on Avast Been using it for free for many years As of late its just basically turned into adware and nagware Been looking for an alternative Even if I turn to a paid program Avast has left such a sour taste in my mouth that I wont even bother entertaining the paid Avast features 

    Where do you live If youre in the UK check your online banking portal I get Kaspersky Internet Security 3 user edition for free simply for banking with Barclays  No nagware In fact it is completely unintrusive  only giving me one browser malware warning legitimate 

    Wrong Windows Defender or Security Essentials is all youll ever need
Treats keygens as what they are and not severe viruses
Never had to format a PC to remove a virus
In fact the only virus I ever had was the breakout of sass virus Windows XP back in 2003 which Norton couldnt clean 

    Hy Simon  I would like to give you one suggestion  please provide us an option of upvoting a good answer here as we have on 9 gag app  I can see a lot of people have brilliant analysis of your articles 

    I see what you wrote again Thought you were complaining about the OP who was bitching about an add You tried to explain to the OP WC needs ads I simply added on we pay for the app meaning a paid app should not have adsduhhhh Is it hard to use a straw with your cleft palate Dont you see it is a misunderstanding And stop insulting your father who turned gay thats lower than the tongue hanging out of your cleft palate 

    Just because you dont like it doesnt mean its terrible Ive been using it for more than a decade and had never had a problem with a virus You might start to bring some made up scenarios as to why thats been the case but truth is the antivirus is a really grat and lightweight tool 

    No Just like apple anything that can be installed has been scanned by the app submission process and theres no other way to install apps without jail breaking the phone Android is not this way and is very similar to a PC in the sense that code can get installed in a number of ways And if youre on jelly bean theres no protection at all anymore  

    If your kids keeps getting that stuff it usually means heshe is installing programsgames and just clicking the next button without reading Not kidding pretty much every bit of freeware will install extras or change your browser usually to Chrome unless you deselect them during install 

    Youre most likely correct However to me more specific its the changing of the search engine within IE More in the malware category than virus And why isnt it illegal for a basic install to include installing another browser and changing your search engine Java updates are notorious for that You always have to go to advance settings just not to infect yourself That practice should be outlawed 

    I feel there should be a program toggleable for separate users that monitors your browsing activity and teaches you what sites are good and what ones are likely harmful while also providing excess protection for the latter unless a password is provided This would be great for kids and the technologically illiterate The user is the first and best defense against malware so teaching people how to browse safely would probably be the best way to promote protection 

    I dont ever trust those lab tests Those same tests always label Norton as the best The most resource hungry anti virus ESET smart security is the best all in one antivirus solution Firewall  antitheft  anti virus proven to work  I never came across a virus eset could not handle Its the best and the lightest on resources 

    I know what youre talking about and in my own personal experience NortonSymantec is actually the worst I will actually tell it to scan an infected file I KNOW its infected and its like nope no problem there Here let me eat more ram and CPU cycles 

    Mean while I try to remotely copy it to an AVG computer and the AVG computer instantly removes it not just from itself but from the source computer as well No matter how how I tried I couldnt infect the AVG computer 

    Ive been using this antivirus for more than a decade and in my experience its a really nice tool Of course Iam a grown up software developer and I know where to search my porn and where not to I mean I know where to search for specific content and where not to 

    If you dont have an antivirus try this one Its just as good as AVG Avast and ther others I believe its just a matter of brand loyalty All are good maybe the components are limited compared to paid antivirus software but the virus protection is great besides Avira is a product of Germany I think it is a trusty piece of software hehe  

    Wow that Avira is expensive Actually one does not need another firewall Windows Firewall is good enough
I just bought ESET Antivirus for 2 years for 2 PCs for 21 altogether You can get it that cheap on ebay licenses for the chinese market but work with any language 

    Its kinda a cross site feature at the moment as Android and iOS have tons of fishy apps and need some type of monitoring Here its just kinda general because the desktop landscape hasnt really changed beyond less viruses and more ransomwaremalware 

    I switched from Avast Free to Panda Antivirus Pro I was using Avast for past 5 years But recently its bogging down my system a lot I have tested all kinds of Antiviruses like Bitdefender Kaspersky Avast AVG etc Then I tried Panda I am very happy with Panda Antivirus Its light on system and effectefly removes malwares Do give it a shot You can also use the free version of Panda Its called Panda Cloud Scanner It basically has the same scan engine as the pro Only difference is the Firewall and Application Control feature which is extra in Pro version 

    Avira Free Antivirus is a useful virus protection software which will protect your computer from spyware rootkits worms phishing hoaxes malware general vulnerabilities and will also detect malicious files The features of this freeware have been focused on website verification tracker blocking and coverage for social networks

    The file protection engine is constantly and automatically updating itself every 6 hours making it a very current utility Besides this freeware can be combined with a smartphone app which provides antitheft and device tracking options However we dont recommend it because it doesnt have a security engine which means that it wont protect you against malware In conclusion Avira Free Antivirus is a musthave security suite which offers a great range of options more than other similar antivirus software such as BitDefender Antivir or Kaspersky 

    Avira Free Antivirus offers you several possibilities and options for keeping your computer protected Once you run it for the first time you will see that there are lots of options in the main interface In the lefthand column called PC Protection you will find the following features Realtime Protection Scan System which will tell you when you performed the last scan and Start Update which will show you when the last update took place  

    At the bottom of that column you will see an option to upgrade your security and a list of tips to be better protected Inside the System Scanner option you will see several secondary possibilities such as scanning specific files or including additional settings In that way you will know if your system has vulnerabilities suspicious files rootkits worms hoaxes phishers malware spyware or any kind of virus Avira Free Antivirus has an internetupdated detailed virus database to respond to the fact that hackers are constantly trying to improve and create new techniques to attack our computers The righthand column is specialized in Internet protection so you will have options such as activating your firewall web and mail protection safe browsing or even game mode In case you find it a bit complicated at the beginning you will be given the possibility to contact a security expert to ask for some help

    it is very reliable and convenient virus scanner that im using for many years detects all malwares and viruses and other unwanted programs without any restriction for users freely and it has daily updating free data base as well

    When the word virus is mentioned many computer users freak out because they are very aware of the damages viruses could cause and thanks to Avira free antivirus every computer user can now relax and not freak out at the mention of the term virus Unlike other antiviruses avira free is easy to use and it intergrates very well with other antiviruses Avira free anti virus automatically updates its virus definations atleast once per day hence the user is assured that their PC is protected  

    The annoying part of this virus is the pop ups which alert the user on the upgrade sometimes its very possible to find oneself canceling the same without the intentions and hence stopping the upgrade I have also noticed since I started using this antivirus my machine perfomance has declined due to the antivirus Avira free antivirus does not detect all antiviruses hence all users should have another antivirus to back it up 

    Avira free antivirus is a software for protecting virus in the computer and it is free It protects the computer against bad people like phishing hoaxes and detects files which seem not trustworthy When browsing and your computer has Avira antivirus feel free because avira is protecting you from bad intruders It keeps checking on your safety while surfing through its improved tool bar It has a file protection engine which updates itself automatically This feature makes it be used by more people

    Some of you may already be familiarized with the lineup of security applications developed by Lavasoft AdAware Free Antivirus Personal Security Pro Security and Total Security They combine two engines including Bitdefenders for detecting and eliminated all popular forms of malware from the computer including viruses Trojans worms spyware and adware 

    In this order each antivirus product comes with more features than the previous one Free Antivirus has an antispyware module realtime protection guard download protection safe browsing component and gaming mode while Personal Security adds shop and bank online safety antiphishing and external storage scan mode 

    Meanwhile Pro Security throws a powerful twoway firewall along with an advanced and realtime email protection into the mix Lastly Total Security which is considered the allin package completes the security circle with parental control digital lock and a file shredder 

    The last three AdAware flavors have different prices However what they all share is the twoway antivirus engine Out of all four products AdAware Free Antivirus is the only one free It is wrapped in a clearcut and comfortable interface featuring options intuitive enough to be figured out even by less experienced users 

    A notable aspect about AdAware is that it can be installed as the primary antivirus solution on the computer or if another such app already exists then you can disable the realtime safeguard and set up AdAware as a secondary line of defense against malware in order to prevent any software conflicts that will likely lead to system failure 

    Apart from the core components the program also offers to install a browser extension for blocking dangerous websites AdAware Web Companion as well as to set SecureSearch as the default homepage and search engine in Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome Any of these modules can be deselected to make a clean installation A reboot is necessary to finish setup 

    At startup it is possible to passwordprotect AdAware by inserting a 4digit number in order to prevent unauthorized users from modifying program settings This is paired with an email address where you will receive the key in case you forget it 

    The interface is clean and intuitive showing the protection summary in the first window when it comes to the last scan date definitions release date number of signatures along with the realtime protection status in addition to the other modules that are not available in the free edition 

    As all serious antimalware applications AdAware lets you conduct multiple scan modes on the computer to check it for viruses depending on the time youre willing to spend A quick scan verifies the critical parts of the hard drive that are the usual hiding places like active processes a full scan takes into account the entire hard disk to perform a thorough search while the custom scan mode enables you to handpick the exact files and folders you want to scrutinize in case you have suspicions 

    During a scan job you can check out the scan type mode estimated time left current scan target and elapsed time along with a progress bar This task can be paused and resumed later if you want to temporarily allocate the resources to other apps 

    If any dangerous items are detected you have the option to delete ignore attempt to heal or send them to a quarantine for further examination Results show the total number of deleted quarantined failed ignored and disinfected files 

    The quarantine zone reveals the threat type and full path for each contained item allowing you to restore them to their original location on the disk or to delete them permanently Ignored items can be consulted in a separate area while scan log details can be checked out in reports AdAware is also capable of running scheduled tasks on a daily weekly or monthly basis depending on your preferences Otherwise the scheduler can be disabled with one click 

    The realtime guard keeps incoming threats at bay and shows notifications for such events on the desktop permitting you to choose the course of action It can be disabled anytime and you can modify its default action quarantine instead of disinfect include archive files emails boot sectors deep scan mode and large file scanning prevention in its radar as well as disable the monitor for network files and smart scan mode 

    As far as app management settings are concerned it is possible to change the program security code enable gaming mode ignore notifications and manage them later change the UI language as well as reset all settings to default  

The program features a realtime guard against incoming threats multiple scanning modes password protection different scanning modes a virus quarantine whitelist reports scheduled scans and gaming mode    There are a ton of options when it comes to antivirus apps on your Android phone or tablet  but there are only a handful of truly free ones Many offer free features with more robust features available as at a premium or subscription basis You can get just as many great features from an unrestricted free app however And in this case were talking alltheway free 

So while we still contend that you dont necessarily need a virus scanner on Android its still a conversation were going to have and were going to look at some of the apps that are currently available    All of these apps offer the basics like virus and malware scanning but a few also have features that go beyond like app managers app locks privacy controls phone finder remote wipe and more So if youre looking for a great free antivirus app for Android look no further than these apps 

    A reminder Viruses and malware are technically not the same thing and there actually arent any true viruses for Android But if you manage to somehow get something bad on your phone it wont really matter what you call it So were using the terms a little interchangeably in this series 

    On the base level Comodo Security  Antivirus keeps you protected from viruses and unsafe apps  but it also offers a set of tweaks to make using your device much safer The always on virus protection scans your phone or tablet and keeps bad software from harming your device Beyond that Comodo offers features like Privacy Protection for storing sensitive information Privacy Advisor for help identifying app permissions SMS and Call Blocking Traffic Monitoring Backup and more 

    There is also a set of AntiTheft codes which allow you to perform actions on your device remotely should it be lost or stolen These codes  activated by SMS  allow you to do things like locate your device sound an alarm take a photo or even wipe your device 

    CM Security Antivirus Applock Not only sports great antivirus protection for your Android device but also an AppLock feature for securing your apps settings and media files The app scans both new and system apps in realtime keeping you safe from any threats to your device Theres also a phone cleanerbooster antitheft features like find my phone and safe browsing to protect you from malicious sites 

    360 Security  Antivirus Boost packs a lot into a small package It doesnt just offer virus protection but also cleans and speed up your device to keep it running in tiptop shape The virus scanner scans apps in realtime  installed apps new apps and memory card content  to ensure you dont install any harmful software It also cleans out junk files large and unused files and frees up memory with just one tap 

    App manager lets you uninstall old apps or APKs that you no longer need or move them to your SD card as a backup There are also builtin antitheft features like find my phone alarm remote lock and more should your device be lost or stolen 

    Sophos Free Antivirus and Security offers a fullfeature set of tools for free including everything from antivirus to loss protection The app scans your software in realtime as you install and alerts you accordingly to anything fishy Ondemand scans can check your whole device and SD card as well 

    Also bundled in are theft protection with remote lock phone finder and alarm features web protection to keep you safe from malicious sites spam filter to block SMS and phone calls application protection to password protect apps and security advisor that tells you how to improve security settings on your device 

    If you arent too concerned with features like app locks or antitheft Malwarebytes AntiMalware offers a great set of tools for keeping you protected from malware and other infected apps Scanning via the app will alert you to malware spyware trojans and other malicious code and alert you so you can act accordingly 

    In addition Malwarebytes offers a privacy manager that shows a breakdown of your installed applications privileges as well as a security audit that shows any vulnerabilities on your device as long as recommendations on how to fix them 

    Bitdefender brings one of the biggest names in antivirus to Android with Bitdefender Antivirus Free This free app needs zero configuration and will keep your device safe from viruses 247 The app uses the same scanning software as Bitdefender Mobile Security  so you know its doing the job right It wont bog down your device either as much of the work is done in the cloud 

    I used avast and it works the best out of all others I tried But that was back when before I figured out you cant get a virus on your phone unless you physically download it I download from third parties all the time just be smart about it 

    Yes it comes preinstalled on Samsung devices and I have used it for the past year and it works quite well Even though im careful with what I download and click on I still like to have it installed just for the extra security 

    You guys forgot lookout that its push in your face by tmobile on most phones I cant deleted on my HTC one m8 I just disable it but on my note 101 2014 I dont know why it keeps coming back even when I disable it damn  

    Just to experiment I have visited some of the worst internet sites on my old android phone guess what not a single virus attack its proves android phones dont need antivirus What was more annoying was the amount of battery these antivirus apps consumed 

    I use AVG Have used for years on computers and laptops Also tablets Have had 5 smart phones so far and never an issue All have had it Scans everything b4 its installed No problems Why isnt this on ur list 

    No Zoner Antivirus The best part about that program is that when you install a new appppp it scans it and lets you know if there are any problems Sounds about the same as every other one out there yah Well one of the problems that it finds that my AVG does not why do I still have that one on my S3 as well too lazy to uninstall most likely is adware and other spyware like that And these are in appppps that you download from the Play Store and the Amazon Appstore It also has all of the usual antitheft features and filtering that the rest have 

    My favorite is AVG Free I have the PC version and its PERFECT I installed the AVG app on my Samsung tab 4 and its no different It also has battery conservation settings I think its the best and I think everyone should try it 

    If you have a Windows computer you need antivirus software There always will be those who will insist that every virus attack is caused due to user error or because the person using the computer wasnt careful enough That statement is only partly true Even if you have all the latest Windows updates installed and are using the latest version of a secure browser there are always some vulnerabilities can be used to attack your computer Good antivirus software stops you from downloading viruses or opening unsafe files Thats why it is essential to have antivirus software installed and updated 

    Many computer dealers will ask you to buy a licence for an antivirus suite along with the PC but free antivirus software along with an antimalware programme form a line of defence thats good enough for most people 

    We looked at tests conducted by PC Mag and independent testing body AVTest as a starting point and weighed them against our our own experiences to compile this list of the best free antivirus software for Windows Here are our picks 

    Avast is easy to understand uses simple language to explain any problems and has a great user interface that anyone can follow It simplifies things like updating to the latest version and keeping the virus list up to date Use silent mode to avoid the excessive announcements 

    Like Avast Panda scored top marks for virus protection in AVTests report Its interface is pretty but not as user friendly as that of Avast It also has a nice feature called USB Vaccine  this prevents virus attacks that occur when you plug in an infected USB drive 

    BitDefenders best feature is that it runs quietly in the background by default It wont bother you until it spots an infection unlike most other antivirus software which need a fair bit of tweaking to get them to stop popping up all the time 

    The software mentioned above are great if you install them before your PC is infected Once theres a virus attack it can get tricky to get install these programmes especially if system functions have been hijacked by the virus Antivirus software can still help but malware removal tools are more effective in cleaning up your computer once the infection has set in 

    Though not technically an antivirus Malwarebytes AntiMalware is a very effective tool for getting rid of malware Its not useful for protecting your PC from virus attacks as it doesnt offer realtime threat protection but is excellent at cleaning up the mess 

    Malwarebytes was in our experience the best tool for malware removal but it still requires you to install it on your infected PC Installing software may not be possible in some heavily infected machines In such cases Comodo Cleaning Essentials 6 will be useful You just need to unzip the file to use this set of virus cleanup tools Comodo Cleaning Essentials 6 is portable software that runs without installation making it useful in worst case scenarios 

    Antivirus software along with a malware cleanup tool should be good enough for most users You can pick any of the software listed above for protection against threats and feel secure when using your computer without having to pay a small fortune for the software 

 Download the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news product reviews and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles      Its hard not to look a gift horse in the mouth when youre told its a potential thoroughbred capable of racing in the Kentucky Derby but later find out its limping on two legs short of a set and isnt even fit for making glue Thats what we think about ClamWin a free opensource antivirus program that comes saddled with gotchas  

     The main problem with ClamWin is it doesnt offer any kind of realtime protection Its strictly an ondemand scanner so your only chance of avoiding infection is to either manually inspect every file you download or set up a rigorous automated scan schedule But even thats a chore because you have to configure a separate schedule for every drivepartition in your system And it doesnt help matters that ClamWins scan engine moves at a snails pace Oh and it wont bother analyzing files larger than 100MB unless you change the default setting nor is it configured to actually delete or even quarantine malware by default Actually we should be careful of using the term malware ClamWin cowers under the blanket when you surf the web leaving you susceptible to spyware phishing attacks browser hijacks adware worms and anything else that requires a realtime scanner And despite the developers claims that you will be as safe as with a commercial antivirus so long as you scan suspicious files before opening them ClamWin gave a handful of our virus samples a clean bill of health Grrr If you insist on using ClamWin if only to support the opensource community supplement it with Clam Sentinel free   an addon that sits in the system tray and offers basic realtime scanning You also better be rocking Windows Defender or some other antispyware program so youre not naked on the web  

    Here on dotTech without a doubt one of the most popular questions we are asked is which antivirus should I use for my computer  what is the best antivirus for Windows Often times the person asking is looking for a free security solution as opposed to a paid one To address this question we have created this review of best free antivirus program for Windows and are going to directly address the issue of what is the best free antivirus program for Windows 

    There are quite a few free antivirusantimalware software for Windows However we picked what we felt are the top six best free antivirus programs for Windows tested them reviewed then compared them and present you with our findings These six are almost the most popular and most commonly inquired about hence why we picked them 

    Also to be clear to be included in this review of best free antivirus programs for Windows a program must have live protection features Many free versions of antivirus or antimalware programs only have on demand protection and dont have live protection eg Emsisoft AntiMalware hence they will never be included in this review 

That said when evaluating best free antivirus programs and trying to decide which one you want to use there are two main areas which you should look at features and performance So lets get started    Here at dotTech weve been reviewing and comparing the best free antivirus programs for Windows for over four years During this time weve updated this review of best free antivirus program for Windows multiple times this review of best free antivirus program for Windows is currently on its 4th Edition fourth update 

    Note Weve had requests from people to include Comodo Internet Security a free security suite that includes antivirus in our review of best free antivirus program for Windows However we have not yet added Comodo Internet Security to our review of best free antivirus program for Windows because we have not been able to find a reliable source that tests the performance of Comodo Internet Security Comodo Internet Security is neither tested by VirusBulletin nor AVComparatives two of the most trusted antivirus testing organizations  

    We feel either AVTest has flawed testing methodology or they provide biased results which is why we are not using their test results for this review of best free antivirus program for Windows If anyone can convince us AVTest results are trustworthy please do let us know and we will be happy to include Comodo Internet Security into our review of best free antivirus program for Windows 

    In terms of features as you can see in the chart above all six of the best free antivirus programs for Windows provide the necessary fundamental protection However it is worth noting that neither of the programs provide fulladvanced phishing protection you will have to cough up money for paid versions to get fulladvanced phishing protection Or you could just be careful about what links you click and doublecheck to make sure the website you are at is who it claims to be since phishing success heavily depends on social engineering and user ambivalence 

    Furthermore while all six best free antivirus programs for Windows provide the fundamentals avast is the most notable one for going above and beyond the basics and providing a little extra bang for the buck or lack thereof In other words avast provides more extra features than the other five best free antivirus programs for Windows although AVG Free also has some nice extras It also should be noted Avira Frees Website Safety Advisor requires users to install Avira Toolbar which is powered by Askcom avast Free and AVG Free install addonsextensions in your browser for their WebGuard and Link Protection features but those are addonsextensions and not toolbars The difference of course is more in appearance than functionality ie avast Free and AVG Frees addons and extensions dont put a literal toolbar in your browser while AVG Frees toolbar does but nonetheless a difference to note 

    On the subject of toolbars aside from its browser addonextension for Link Protection AVG Free comes bundled with AVG Secure Search Security Toolbar AVG Secure Search Security Toolbar is essentially bloatware and is very hard to uninstall once you get it on your computer in fact in my experience the toolbar behaves like malware If you end up opting to get AVG Free I highly recommend keeping your eyes open while installing AVG Free and to uncheck and not install AVG Secure Search security Toolbar 

    That being said let me point out a fundamental difference between these best free antivirus programs for Windows Avira Free avast Free AVG Free and Microsoft Security Essentials are traditional antivirus programs they operate offline doing all the scanning on your computer and regularly downloading signature database updates On the other hand Panda Cloud Free and Bitdefender Free are cloudbased antivirus programs Although they both also operate when you dont have an active internet connection their main strength is that they leverage the power of the cloud to protect you most of the hard work and processing is down via the cloud and not your own computer and you never download any signature databases because it is all hosted in the cloud 

    The primary advantage of using cloudbased antivirus programs is they lessen the load  and slow down your computer less  than traditional antivirus programs However the flip side is you dont get as good protection if you dont have an active internet connection Enough about that though  we will talk more details about computer load and protection in the performance section below in this review of best free antivirus programs for Windows 

    Lastly even though Microsoft Security Essentials is the only one to not prompt users with advertisements it must be noted that the ads in avast Free and Bitdefender Free are comparatively nonintrusive and less frequent than the other best free antivirus programs  they are not as annoying as what Avira Free and AVG Free do 

    Firstly you will notice we did not list Bitdefender Free as having ondemand scanning capabilities This is because Bitdefender Free does not have the ability to initiate an ondemand scan of your whole computer  it only has the ability to initiate and ondemand scan of individual foldersfiles which we feel is incredibly stupid 

    When Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition detects what it feels is a malicious website or malicious file it automatically blocks the filewebsite  you are given no ability to override the block I can understand why Bitdefender behaves like this they dont want users to be infected because they wrongly overrode Bitdefender and allowed a malicious file to be executed or a malicious website to be loaded So is a good thing for the average Joe who has no idea what button to press when prompted with a scary malware has been detected message However all antivirus programs including Bitdefender are prone to have some false positives Not giving users the ability to override Bitdefender actions or not giving users the ability to select what they want to do with a suspected malicious file means you simply have to live with any false positives Bitdefender detects which is very poor form on the part of Bitdefender 

    By behaving like this basically Bitdefender is saying We are always right and you are too stupid to make your own decisions So bend over and take it I dont know about you but I aint bending over and it has nothing to do with my wife getting jealous 

    That all being said the two above mentioned test results tell us one story the results are a clear indication of Aviras detection superiority True aside from Microsoft Security Essentials which has a significantly low rate of 901 and avast which has a nottoolowstillprovidesgoodprotectionbutissurprising rate of 965 in on demand tests all of the free antivirus programs for Window provide excellent protection when doing on demand scans However when you factor in the ability to block zeroday attacks RetrospectiveProactive AntiMalware Tests Avira shines above the lot with a commanding 84 block rate of newunknown malware 

    It is important to note that Aviras high protection comes at a cost Avira has very many false positives Having very many false positives means Avira will block safe files more often than other antivirus programs So while it has the best protection rates be prepared to use your assessment skills to determine if a file Avira thinks is malicious is actually malicious or not 

    If the issue of false positives is important to you then Microsoft Security Essentials is the best of the lot  but there is a tradeoff you get less false positives and you also get less protection Yep nothing in life is without tradeoffs 

    At this point you may be thinking hang on a second Ashraf doesnt Bitdefender have tiptop protection in both on demand and zeroday protection tests This is true Bitdefender does show excellent protection rates  in fact Bitdefenders protection against newunknown malware is better than Aviras as per these tests But keep in mind the tests were done using Bitdefender AntiVirus not Bitdefender Antivirus Free aka Bitdefender Free 

    Typically as Ive said above the difference between paid and free versions of each antivirus program is not important for the purposes of our simple analysis to try to determine which free antivirus program is the best We are after all using the best data results we have at hand In this particular case however it is important to differentiate between Bitdefender AntiVirus and Bitdefender Free for the RetrospectiveProactive AntiMalware Tests Why Because there was no active internet connection while RetrospectiveProactive AntiMalware Tests were conducted and Bitdefender Free is a cloudbased antivirus whereas Bitdefender AntiVirus is not as cloudbased 

    As already mentioned cloudbased antivirus still work offline but more often than not they dont perform as well For example Panda Cloud Free performs as well as Avira in OnDemand AntiMalware Tests when internet connection was active but does not perform as well as Avira in RetrospectiveProactive AntiMalware Tests when there was no access to the internet This means more likely than not if Bitdefender Free was tested in RetrospectiveProactive AntiMalware Tests then it would probably not perform as well as the 97 of Bitdefender AntiVirus We dont really know how well Bitdefender Free would perform but I venture to say it would perform in the late 70s maybe early 80s similar to Panda Cloud Free 

    So then lets cut past all the crap and get down to it which is the best when it comes to detection rates Frankly there is no best  they are all good with the exception of MSE But if I were to rank the best free antivirus programs based only on detection rates my top three would be Avira Free Panda Cloud Free and Bitdefender Free After that fourth is avast Free following by AVG Free and MSE 

    Being able to detect malware has value in and of itself simply knowing you are infected is worthwhile However an antivirusantimalware program that cannot remove malware is probably one you dont want to have Hence we look at the results of a malware removal effectiveness test 

    Before we discuss the results it must be noted this malware removal effectiveness test had limited scope  it only used eleven samples It is hard and frankly not fair or logical to draw authoritative conclusions based on a test that only used eleven samples However for the purposes of a nonauthoritative indicator this test will do just fine as long as you keep in mind the limited scope 

    Also remember this test was conducted on the free versions of avast Panda Cloud and MSE but on the paid versions of Avira and Bitdefender So it is goes without saying Bitdefender and Avira has a leg up on the others for this test because paid versions always have more features than free versions Nonetheless this is an interesting test to evaluate 

    That said Avira and Bitdefender show they superior skills once again Avast and Panda come in a seconds with MSE a relatively distant last As I said this test used only eleven samples so we cant say only Avira and Bitdefender are good while the others are incompetent at removing malware The results very well could have been different if different eleven malware samples were picked That is why having a large randomized sample size is important in any test The sample for this test was randomized but the size is a bit small However the results are still interesting because they show one fact no one single antivirus program can remove all malware Most antivirus remove most malware but none remove all  at least not without external help which comes in the form of a boot disc in this case 

    Generally speaking the computer impact of all six best free antivirus programs is about the same True avast does come out on top but only by a small margin  and this small margin will likely only noticed when benchmarking not in reallife usage Really if you take a look at the first graph the six best free antivirus programs perform similarly across the vast majority of tests Indeed the Computer Impact test ended up with results that are too close to draw lines between 

    What is interesting however is how Panda Cloud Free not only fails to top the rankings but it is at the bottom of the pack Sure as I just said the differences between the results for each product is not very significant However one of the major selling points of using a cloudbased antivirus is that it has less of an impact on your computer and does not slow your computer down as much as traditional AVs That is the tradeoff you are supposed to get for accepting underperformance of cloudbased AVs when not connected to the internet These test results however seemingly contradict claims of cloudbased AVs  Panda Cloud Free in this case  being more lightweight than traditional AVs That is not to say cloudbased AVs such as Panda Cloud Free are more heavy than traditional AVs however these test results suggest they arent more light either 

    For those that dont know PC Mark is a professional industryrecognized benchmarking tool The higher PC Mark score the better However when it comes to PC Mark few points here and there have no significant meaning If PC Mark scores were drastically different such as 5 or more then it would be worth looking at 

    In our previous Detection Rates section we discussed the ability of our six best free antivirus programs for Windows to block known malware and unknownknown malware zeroday in a lab setting  a way to benchmark their detection rates In this section we are doing something similar However we are testing the protection provided by the six best free antivirus programs for Windows by trying to emulate a reallife setting instead of a lab 

    The obvious advantage of testing the six best free antivirus programs for Windows in a reallife setting over a lab setting is reallife protection rates are more relevant to end users than protection rates A notsoobvious advantage is the reallife test results are a few months more current than the tests done in the lab setting they are still a few months old at the time of this writing but they are more current than the other tests A disadvantage is the sample size of the reallife test is a lot smaller than the lab setting test however the reallife sample size is still statistically sound and larger than 1000 for each product 

    For the purposes of this reallife test the ability of the six best free antivirus programs for Windows to block known and unknown malware files and URLs was analyzed Each program was left at default settings had an active internet connection during these tests and the test was conducted over a span of four months using the following versions of each program 

    As you can see the RealLife Protection Rates test results are largely similar to the results shown previously Avira avast Panda Cloud and Bitdefender all provide excellent protection and MSE still falls way below the pack The exception to this is AVG which has seen its performance from lab setting test drop by a large amount 

    Whereas in our previous Detection Rates test the lab setting AVG was running with the pack near the front AVG is now near the bottom in the RealLife Protection Rates test results And while a rate of 957 would be acceptable in a lab setting to miss almost 5 of malware in a reallife setting really makes me question AVGs usefulness as an antivirus program Sure blocking 957 of malware in a reallife setting is nothing to sneeze at But it is also nothing to write home about either To make matters worse the paid version of AVG was tested so the free version is bound to have even lower protection rates 

    Note All tests referenced in all Performance Comparison subsections of this article were not conducted by dotTech They the tests were conducted by AVComparativesorg an authority on security software testing I attained permission to republish AVComparatives results on dotTech when I originally wrote this article 

    And here is the section youve all been waiting for the final verdict After considering all aspects of the six best free antivirus programs for Windows which ones stand out above the crowd Which one is the best of the lot Which ones should be avoided Lets talk shall we 

    While there are some noteworthy aspects  such as Aviras excellent protection and removal performance  there is no one winner between Avira Free vs avast Free vs AVG Free vs Panda Cloud Free vs Bitdefender Free vs Microsoft Security Essentials To try to determine which one is the best is like trying to split hairs it is hard to do and it hurts Still that doesnt mean we cant try now does it  

    After considering all the results  from our Features Comparison and Performance Comparison Detection Rates Malware Removal Effectiveness Computer Impact RealLife Protection Rates sections  I rank Avira Free avast Free and Panda Cloud Free the top three best free antivirus programs for Windows in no particular order 

    Bitdefender Free is also very good but I personally dont like the arrogance of the program ie not letting me pick what to do with detected malicious filesURLs and not having ability to scan whole computer on demand Microsoft Security Essentials comes dead last and it should not be a surprise why it provides poor performance when compared to the rest even thought it has the least amount of false positives AVG Free ranks before Microsoft Security Essentials but after Bitdefender Free AVG Free is a decent overall package but has no notable aspects  it doesnt shine in any categories and I personally question why AVG would not want to participate in some of tests we talked about in this review of best free antivirus programs for Windows 

    With that said what program you should use comes down to your specific needs and desires Want the most features avast Free is the way to go Are you looking for the best protection and dont care about anything else like features or false positives Avira Free is for you Hate ads avast Free Bitdefender Free and MSE win out in that category Note I dont recommend MSE no matter how much you hate ads but the choice is yours Are you a social network addict Go with AVG Free for it has Social Network Protection Hate false positives Avoid AVG Free Avira Free and Panda Cloud Free and consider avast Free or Bitdefender Free Download lots of software avast Frees Auto Sandbox may be your next best friend Are you techunsavvy dont know what to click when your antivirus flags a file or URL and would prefer to allow your antivirus make the decision of which file or URL to block Bitdefender Free is your best pick 

    As you can see there are too many moving parts for us to tell you what is the best free antivirus program for you We have provided you with the facts now the choice of Avira Free vs avast Free vs AVG Free vs Panda Cloud Free vs Bitdefender Free vs Microsoft Security Essentials is in your hands So roll up your sleeves and pick one if your first pick doesnt work out dont be afraid to experiment and try out one or two more before deciding on your final one Whichever one you pick rest assured all of the best free antivirus programs for Windows mentioned in this program are good except for Microsoft Security Essentials  

    Avira and Panda are the strongest contender they have the strongest viral capture rate out of everything out right now  Avira I cant talk about but I know Pandas so called viral capture rate is mostly based around false positives and with two pcs one running Panda another running MSE with mostly the same viral activity clicking on shifty links opening lots of ads Both laptops in parallel I found that 1 Panda blocks a lot of websites claiming they could harm your pc yeah adw Cleaner could really harm my adware 2 After a week long extensive analysis I did a complete cleanup running Malwarebytes AntiMalware Hitman Pro Adw Cleaner and Kasperskys Virus cleaning tool The Panda Laptop had over 1700 Malware programsFolderskeys only over MB AntiMalware while the MSE one got a little over 30 total Same Activity 1h a day over 7 days 3 So you have theory and Practice here and both seem very disconnected I Seriously dont know has a strong MicropsSoft critique 

    At the moment Avira and Panda are the strongest contender they have the strongest viral capture rate out of everything out right now Being free you can install both and have the best of both worlds as for malware stick with Malwarebytes 

    Great to see that Avira is still among the best I have it installed on all my Windows computers for many years now and would not change to anything else And with bgpkiller its now an even better option 

    On this site COMODO Antivirus is considered the best For a long time I hesitated to change my free antivirus Avira AntiVir for COMODO but because COMODO Firewall is my preferred firewall since a couple of years I have always been inclined to accept the idea to give COMODO Antivirus a try 

    That is what I am doing since 4 to 5 weeks and everything is going very well I know that COMODO Antivirus has a detection rate which is a little bit inferior to Avira but it has something that Avira doesnt have  a sandbox Also I run some other security softwares which bring a certain compensation for that 

    My security is constituted by  COMODO Firewall and Antivirus SpyShelter Premium Lifetime license Malwarebytes Antimalware Pro Lifetime license SUPERAntispyware Pro Lifetime license and Malwarebytes AntiExploit Free 

    I know that many will maybe say that it is better to run a minimum of security softwares but I can assure these persons that everything is running quietly  the CPU and memory activity rates are all very low and there is no conflict between any of all these softwares 

    Thanks a lot for your work you did just 1 question and 1 recommendation As 2015 passed by almost half is there update available or on the way of this comparison And maybe a final chart with the results of all tested candidates in the specific tasks allows a quick overview about the strength and weakness of the AV in the specific fields Cheers from Centralamerica Gerry 

    Qihoo has had great test results beating all but a few of the paid antiviruses But it is only recently that Qihoo has gotten in on the testing I believe most of its great results have come after the most recent update of this article 

    Yes we have exchanged comments awhile back You commended me on my English remember Thanks again As a matter of fact i do use WinPatrol Malwarebytes Free Scanner and also have SpyBlaster and once in awhile run AdwCleaner and Emisoft Hijack Free I try to keep my PC as clean as possible and i also use SOLUTO which has brought down my boot time to 28 seconds Its just like you mentioned no 2 computers are the same and also no 2 computer users habits are equal We all have different setups and we configure our systems in different ways so its like you say most of these test are not quite reliable but only concerning the PCs configuration where it was tested We should all do our own little testand decide which is best on our PCs I always tell my friends that there is no such thing as the perfect antivirus and we all know that so just like many of have done we use additional tools for backup security like you and i have already mentioned Concerning MSE well it hasnt updated or anything close for quiet awhile and even though many recommend MSE its performance is subpar i just dont trust it And what about Panda its very light on resources and cloud based and does an exceptional job for the crazy price of zero   FREE Hope to here from you MikeR soon 

    melen001 Not sure if weve corresponded before via dot tech review threads on the subject of AVs but anyway at risk of repetition I can tell you that Ive used Panda Cloud AV Free almost since the day it was launched and am still using it now Its light its unobtrusive and it works If it didnt work Id have dumped it long since But an AV is only one part of a defense armory So the happy Panda icon sits in my tray here next to the blueandblack Scottie icon WinPatrol PRO and the blue rotorbladethingies of Malwarebytes PRO The three play nicely The three never obstruct or slow down this computer The three have never let any nasty in and have always reacted instantly to threats 

    But thats on my computer And as not a single AV lab test undertaken anywhere in the world is ever going to prove that any two computers are the same or that any two users computing habits are identical or indeed that any computer anywhere is configured the same way as an AV lab test rat then actually my experience means nothing at all 

    About the only thing that I take for definite from Ashraf is that Microsoft Security Essentials is well and truly dead Microsoft was going through one of its periodic weloveourcustomers phases when it launched MSE but its done little to update it or even promote it Having seen its performance or lack of it where friends and colleagues machines are concerned I actually regard it as a hindrance not a help and one that increasingly borders on being UTU Unsafe To Use 

    jay No review including Ashrafs is proof of anything As Ashraf rightly points out the outcome of his tests on a computer of his configuration are there to serve as a benchmark for others While its also true that Ashrafs quality of work is consistently high the same can definitely not be said for some of the socalled big name AV test labs out there whose enthusiasts ought to check out their criteria before exulting that this or that lab test scored this or that AV higher As for BitDefender hopefully it has cleaned up its act I was an early user of a version that fell apart due to a botched update which BitDefender was epically slow to even admit let alone fix Add to that the sheer weight of complaints about BitDefenders alleged Customer Service  billing and its easy to see why so many computer users still steer clear of it  this despite the aggressive discounting the company has been engaging in over recent months 

    Yeah Im back Thats right its the Norton Antivirus fan and loyalist to the bone me Got a surprise i uninstalled Norton a few weeks ago and currently using Panda Free Antivirus V 1501 Why did i change Well as you all know there is no such thing as a perfect antivirus and each one has its pros and cons but after seeing the latest AVComparativesorg reports of the past month of September and judging by the scores Panda  Avira happen to on the top take a look    So i choose Panda for its cloud feature Pros does its job and no slowing down of my PC Cons in the past 2 weeks i have received a small popup ad telling me to up date which is not discouraging for me What to you guys have to say about Panda hope to hear from you guys soon 

    I was thinking about your comment about bitdefender the arrogance of never asking anything to the user and got the clearest conclusion that outside the field of computer science everyone I know who have more than 30 years old need this antivirus 

    I do not know anyone who cares about this they want to USE THEIR COMPUTER without annoying security programs that keep asking things they do not know what they are and do not know what it means unless of course the question comes from FACEBOOK  

    Daphne I recommend and use AVG and am very satisfied with its results You can download a 1 year trial of AVG Internet Security the paid version for free from the following site its where I got mine from   

    Thank you for such a fantastic review I am currently using Microsoft Security Essentials at the advice of my beloved local geeks but I have read so much about how Microsoft is lagging in recent years that I want to try something new 

    Youve done quite an exhaustive study But there are many antivirus softwares like kaspersky quick heal comodo etc that are quite good I have personally used both kaspersky and quick heal over the years and both have worked well for me 

    I have personally had many more false positives with inbound emails or web traffic using Avast Free than I have so far with Avira Free I am now going on a month since the change over Just thought I would share 

    David Roper Have to say it baffles me that dot tech seems not to be moderated as closely as it might be dfilesru is DepositFiles a Russian filesharing website Im surprised to see dot tech continuing to publicise it 

    Ghost Ironically for a discussion forum about computing threats and online safety the link youve posted to a Russian website doesnt seem to me to have much to do with  Should dottech be advising care here 

    FYI it has now an option to continueat your own risk to the blocked site and there is now commands in quarantine objects like restore delete and open file location Full system scan is just a rightclick away on the taskbar icon then select Full System Scan The best hasslefree effective and intelligent product youll ever have FREEEEEE 

    David Young One of the best solutions to avoid infecting your PC with malware is to surf the internet using sandbox software If you accidently click on the wrong thing and download malware just delete the sandbox I use Sanboxie Free 

    These kinds of reviews may be a little help for the unenlightened but are far from realistic eg Aviras false positive rate is so high that the product becomes completely unbearable in a very short time Thats bad enough for a normal user but for programmers where its normal to have Avira complain about at least 1 in 5 of the software you create yourself it gets removed very rapidly 

    Ive used Avira Avaste and AVG amongst many others in a business environment and can tell you that the success rate of the first two is nowhere near as high as reviews such as this seem to indicate On the other hand their false positive rates are disproportionately higher So high in fact that I get nothing but complaints from the users AVG is an excellent product because its success rate is higher that this review would have us believe while its false positive rate is much lower that the other two 

    The arrogance of Bitdefender is because they want you to upgrade for the fatures  thats what its there for set it and forget it ideal for relatives with limited IT knowledge Also Bitdefender DOES include on demand you right click the icon and go FULL scan Clearly the winner in all tests and constantly on top from all tests along side paid kaspersky free with a barclays bank account 

    David RoperWhether from fear or other choice not everyone needs to be online Its no different than any other choice one may make no matter the reason or the popularity I have chosen to not have a car and not to drive rural public transit with all its limitations works for me You neednt be happy or sad just accept that its his way 

    MikeR MikeR they buy the junk because of Educational Computer Vacuum ECV I just had my 72 year old friend call me about how to save something to his FlashDrive I gave him instead of Floppy 35 inch Hes running XP and I bought him an illustrated Book on XP use 

    He will never see this because he is not connected to the Web and will not budge because the Radio Internet Goddess has scared him silly about spies and people sneaking onto his computer while he sleeps 

    I do not know whether to cry or laugh I have given up on him EVER connecting to the web The Goddess has scared him so much But he calls me on the phone and I will go there Wednesday to help him once again on his XP Sad Happy 

    I agree with Rob Avast Free once the rightful favorite of so many but now a moneyhungry pile of intrusive junk is actually the most beneficial software around for stimulating cerebral activity amongst senior brains 

    I have now had to uninstall this crap from not one but three computers each time in Safe Mode using Avasts own uninstaller cos doing it any other way wont succeed On each occasion the senior owners of these computers have said things like oooer look at that Safe Mode never seen that before and since then have regularly interrupted Windows bootup by keypressing and fingerjabbing and generally having the most fantastic fun realising  for perhaps the first time  that they are the masters not the sodding computer And definitely not grubby bloated software like Avast Free Not sure if it does keep Alzheimers entirely away though I mean there has to be an explanation as to why some people actually buy Avast   

    I reckon Avast is the best It is so good that every yearly renewal they try to trick the elderly and the feeble minded into getting the paid version I am both elderly and feeble minded so the yearly test helps keep Alzheimers away Rob 

    Ill add another one to consider AdAware Antivirus Ive been using it for the last month when my free Avg went south with my new computer Ive not had any problems with slow downs initial scan wasnt very long etc It also has excellent reviews over at cnetcom    I use it in conjunction with Online Armor free Firewall 

    J PC genius I suspect the next best free choice would be avast or Comodo Internet Security or Panda Or if youre able to overcome the reasons to distrust an AV company thats tight with the hackerloving Peoples Republic of China government   then Qihoo has the best test results for any free antivirus 

    Bitdefender is hands down the best free antivirus software in 2014 However I cannot get it to work on my laptop I think it may conflict with my other programs Anybody know of a close second I could try Thanks 

 RobCr Thank you very much for making this contact with Noscripts developers I recently installed it but it was too much for me I disabled it till I really have time to sit down and study it in detail    Firefox does have a lot of problem recognizing that it has finished loading a page and it keeps on in loading mode needlessly Nonetheless the Gecko family browsers can handle large numbers of tabs without eating ones system resources alive far better than any of the Chromium family browsers 

    Firefox is a bit slow these days slow loading pages and NoScript can be a pain in the butt However anyone who is not using that combination for their unsafe browsing is an idiot sorry but I am trying to get the attention of the Chrome worshippers out there By all means have another browser eg IE for your safe trusted sites but FF  Noscript is the only way to surf safely Rob PS I have been in touch with the Noscript creators to give us a quicker way to allow a web page that we decide we trust Currently you have to click allow many times as cascading scripts appear Allow one set and then more want to run and need another click However the creators feel we are children and cannot be trusted to do that allowing quickly 

    David Young David Young WOW well yes those programs everyone knows that they are nothing but walware but what about what we dont know  And how about all that sneaks up and you can not see or detect Sure i know what you mean but still i rather have my antivirus in place just in case 

    You really dont need antivirus none of them stop when you click on malware programs like regcure pro registry optomizer pro babylon toolbar conduit search protect I remove these viruses from PCs that have full versions of Norton McAfee etc they are useless you just have to know what NOT to click on 

    Bonosio Everyone has their favorite firewall Ive found that Online Armor free works well with just about everything provided youre running Win 7 SP1 gotta have SP1 installed and running smooth I had previously used Private Firewall which worked really well but it was a resource and memory hog causing long delays during startup Hope this helps you BearPup 

    Excellent article Ashraf I was running Bitdefender free on a desktop wWindows 7 64bit fast and smooth Before this I was using Avast free  was annoyed that it was slowing my startup Replaced Bitdefender free for Zonealarm Extreme Security and my problems started I changed IE 11 for IE 10 and every time I try to shutdown I get a notice that there is an update to do When I install it my computer goes off the network and have to use the troubleshooter to fix it then it will work until I go to shutdown and the episode keeps repeating Zonealarm had me reinstalling it  it repeats over  over Can somebody suggest a solution I am thinking about removing zone alarm  reinstalling Bitdefender free an IE 11 Any suggestion for free firewall antispam  antiphising Open to any recommendation for improving  fixing what I have Thanks 

    But to be complete this is what my current computer is comprised of Magic Micro AMD FX4300 Quad Core 38 GHz 12 GB RAM Graphics ATI Radeon R7 260X 2G GDD5 memory 500 GB SATA 3 Hybrid SSHDD 500 GB SATA 3 HDD Thermaltake V3 Air Cooled Case LG IPS LED Monitor MSE is not running defeated via a hack from The Windows Club OS is Windows 7 Home Premium x64 

    I recently purchased a new computer and needed a new antivirus application I initially tried AdAware Antivirus but when Bitdefender offered 6 months free I figured Id try it out All of a sudden my new smoothly running machine started acting weird  programs wouldnt run correctly access to control panel disappeared and I couldnt shut my machine down without crashing the system 

    As the only thing that I had changed was antivirus applications I quickly uninstalled Bitdefender and reinstalled Adaware My system has run smoothly ever since Perhaps you could include Adaware antivirus in your next roundup 

Mr Ashraf this is a good article but Bitdefender Free has the ability to initiate an ondemand scan of your whole computer Just right click on the taskbar icon of bitdefender and find full system scan    Perhaps overjoyed by the perf of OA  Avast on my Vista laptop I jumped the gun and attempted a similar change on an XP desktop first uninstalled Outpost Free Firewall then disabled Avast shields as recommended by the OA installer but with some trepidation P and then installed OA 

    Pressing the Windows key does nothing Ctrlaltdelete brings up the narrator screen instead of the Task Manager System Restore doesnt work get an error msg to the effect cannot restore please reboot Rebooting doesnt resolve anything Rebooting in Safe Mode w networking simply brings up a black screen similar to the CMD screen but still no Start button or Taskbar 

    However WindowsR does bring up the search box from which I can run commands OA seems to be on but scarily Avast shields are turned OFF and cannot be enabled even when I bring up the Avast UI and try from there 

    I am able to run Chrome from the search box and access the internet but the top few recommended solutions from a Google search such as CtrlEsc closing and restarting the explorerexe process editing the winlogonshell entry in regedit have all failed to yield positive results 

    Excellent article with practical tips Great job Ashraf After putting up with a year of incessant alerts from Outpost Free Firewall Ive just switched over to Online Armor Free and its a breeze running simultaneously with Avast Free Antivirus and WinPatrol 

    My 64bit Vista laptop is now booting up delightfully quicker In the past Ive used and jettisoned ZoneAlarm and AVS firewalls settling in favor of Outpost despite the annoying popups Comodo just wouldnt downloadinstall properly on my machine much to my chagrin after 2 painful 200MB downloads P 

    Likewise Ive tried and abandoned AVG Avira and BitDefender antivirus Avast just seems to work better on this machine Ive now reset Avast shields as per MikeRs recommendations thanks Mike And yes File Shield is ON  

    Nice to see that the Dottech community is responding to the latest comments concerning Norton and that you are open at discussing of what is going on with Norton security products and how are they performing in real time Its like you say when you mention food and people some may like it while others dont Such is life in the PC world Hope to hear from you soon 

    MikeR Hi MikeR Thank you for the stimulating comment on my English I live in Puerto Rico and my native language is Spanish so its good to know that I am expressing myself in a correct manner Thank you for taking me up on my suggestion on revising Norton and performing a comprehensive review would certainly be welcomed and maybe we can get an idea of what Norton is offering the PC community and if Norton can live up to the standards of a well defined antivirus suite Just hope Ashraf sees the comments that have been recently posted and a review of Norton could be scheduled in the near future Definitely a good idea where we can all benefit and leave behind any negative thoughts and experiences which we might have concerning Norton security products May I ask you mention Your command of the English language is manifestly greater than that which I find in far far too many   English  am I to understand that when you mention English is it that you are from England Like I have mentioned before if it werent for spellcheck I would be practically lost Well thanks for your feedback and your suggestions are more than welcome and hoping to hear from you soon 

    I agree with MikeR Ive long felt that software and computers are like foods and people The same food that serves many people quite well is detrimental to the health of some people and must be avoided by them Software programs seem to work the same way with computers I have a friend whose computer got sick after he downloaded Malwarebytes and recovered after he uninstalled it I have a friend who is very happy with Norton but the negative buzz keeps me away from it PC Advisor ranks Norton at the top and of course they get a lot of grief for that 

    melen001 Ye Gods if thats how well you can write in your second language   Im using my first and only so kudos to you As for a revisiting of Norton what an excellent idea Everything has a time a season and Id be really interested to see if Nortons time has come around again a comprehensive review would at the very least be a real comment stimulator Thanks again melen001  and no you didnt say anything that sounded funny Your command of the English language is manifestly greater than that which I find in far far too many   English 

    MikeR Hi MikeR Nice to see someone not bashing me or Norton for an instance Like you say no 2 computer users experience are alike and that happens to be my case I can understand the dissatisfaction that my Dottech friends have experienced and that is just fine Im not trying to convince anyone on the merits that Norton might have or not Its just my personal experience and thats all I see that you understand that there is no such thing as a typical computer and of course that being said experiences will differ Maybe a actualized review of Norton would be a good idea Just in case Im not an employee or anything like that of Symantec or Norton nor am I a professional software reviewer or IT technician of any sort I consider myself a normal PC aficionado and my technical skills I would say are rather limited That doesnt mean that I am not able to make a judgement on how my PC is operating Just wanted to get that out of the way And its like you stated no two computer users experiences are going to be the same So in the hopes that maybe someone might take me up on my suggestion on reviewing Norton on nonbios terms we can really find out if Norton is really offering an authentic product that can satisfy our security needs Isnt that what its all about Thanks for you comment and hope to hear from you guys soon 

    Absolutely Im amazed to learn of melen001s experience because though its the first favourable detailed post of its kind Ive come across its obviously genuine  an authentic reflection of the reality that no two computers are the same which is why Ive always advocated staying well clear of registry cleaners and registry optimizers seeing as how theyre based on some developers idea of what a typical computer actually is   when there aint no such thing as typical All I can say speaking from experience is that while I wholeheartedly concur with the thrust of melen001s remarks about Norton  Symantec I did find Peter Nortons software considerably more than halfway useful in days of old  when it was still the good doctors personal baby After that well    melen001 is talking about a two and a half year period from October 2011 and in that time Ive probably had to deal with half a dozen instances  yup I know doesnt sound a lot but then Im not running a computer business just helping out friends as and when such is possible  where Norton has slowed computers to a crawl and hasnt even performed anything like as well as freeware alternatives Its not then the distant past which has left me so averse to Norton rather that in 2011 2012 and in 2013 I was still finding reasons to get the stuff stripped out Ultimately what melen001 says sheds a welcome fresh light on the reality mentioned earlier that no two computers are the same so really no two computer users experiences are going to be the same either 

    Were not bashing melen001 here We are bashing Norton AV The furst thing I do when setting up a friends machine is try to remove Norton AV A least the guts of it Then Glary and CCleaner and get fir of whats left then install Avast avira or AVG sometimes flipping a coin in front of the user I let AVG win most of the time 

    I have a couple of PCs However I have one main one that is used 95 of the time and all my important computing is done on and resides in one PC If Norton offered to pay me 50 a year to to install their program in my important PC I would refuse 

    MikeR From what i see none of you guys like Nortons software and its difficult for me to understand And to find anyone anywhere on the entire internet who has had a satisfying experience sound like bull to me I do know that the only answer I can give is that Norton and Symantec spent better than a decade of vending crapware and resting on their laurels Not to mention their arrogance in refusing tech support to anyone unless they were willing to get totally gouged Oddly Norton was a half way useful product in the days of win98 but for win95 and XP it was totally worthless And after Norton spent a decade pissing the knowledgeable off its somewhat absurd to assume that many will ever be willing to forgive Norton so soon and thats understandable I guess thats all i have to say Either way i will stick Norton 

    Interesting to see that someone here has had a satisfying twoandahalf year experience of Norton Actually its interesting to find anyone anywhere on the entire Internet who has had a satisfying experience of Norton from October 2011 thru to today Congratulations to melen001 then for being what would appear to be a real winner in lifes software lottery and particularly for being able to renew Norton not once but four consecutive times for absolutely nothing at all Just goes to show theres an exception to every rule  the rule or at the least the advisory being not to go anywhere near this bloated resourcehogging intrusive ineffectual expensive parody of Peter Nortons original elegant work 

    Nortons in charge are you joking or what of course Im in charge I have never had any intrusive behavior issues with Norton I see that you are referring to Wins 98 and I assume that if you experienced that behavior with Norton that was some time ago And if is or was true this is the first time I have heard about such a thing You seem to imply something like remote access by Norton on your PC and that really sounds quite strange may I say And snail mail Im guessing that you actually received physical mail at your home or something like that The answer is NO never not even email or popups or online and as a matter of fact any kind of nuisance at all from Norton Like you stated The wall that Norton comes up against is their behavior of old  you said it old You state that millions have experienced that behavior from Norton and I quite doubt that assumption you have stated as true Im not saying your experience is doubtful but that has not been my case in the last 2 12 years using Norton I am quite pleased with there software and support service which I have used and quite frankly is excellent Can i say that they have changed no I cant say that because I have never had any such issues with Norton I appreciate you comments so thanks for your concern and I will stay with Norton Antivirus 2014 for now You never know if something better comes around 

    melen001 The wall that Norton comes up against is their behavior of old and not knowing differently maybe still The behavior Im referring to was their intrusiveness into a persons life and computer And Im being quite literal here I got snail mail from Norton the one and only time I signed up for their service And online was just as intrusive   I literally had to wipe my hard drive clean and reinstall the thenoperation system of Windows 98 

    Because of that experience I vowed never again And given my experience and millions of others these questions are asked can you honestly say that they have changed Do you feel your computer is still yours or does it feel in someway that Nortons in charge 

    Thanks for your concern and the OS I am using is Wins 764 I was using Norton before with the same offer 180 days 6 months with free product key It doesnt cost me a single penny to use Norton And about your concern after the 180 days well I just signup again but with a different email address I did that last year so thats not an issue If you are wondering why I tried the other Antivirus brands its that after seeing all the different reviews and the excellent scores they received that led me to try them out and maybe change to what seemed better protection at the moment But after experimenting and using them with different settings and whatnots I discovered that my best bet was Norton and of course FREE for 6 months We all know that there isnt such thing as ONE BEST antivirus They all do a wonderful job at what they where designed for and each one has its pros and cons so I dont consider choosing among them a big deal You can go and see for yourself if you would like to try Norton just go HERE  

    melen001 You should tell us what version of windows you are using and whether it is 32 0r 64 bit as some of your discarded ones can perform differently depending on which OS we have Over the years many of us have become gun shy with Norton Rob PS Many of us are too tight to pay the 50 that Norton will want at the end of your 180 free days What are you planning to do at the end of your 180 days  

    I tried Avast and dumped it then I installed Avira and dumped it also and finally went with Bitdefender and the same results got rid of it too So what do I have on my PC I installed Norton Antivirus 2014 with 180 day product key for FREE This might sound weird but the others where slowing down my PC and I just got tired changing and using different settings trying to make them perform well but not to bog down my PC speed I was experimenting for over a month and the only one that does not compromise my PC speed is Norton I dont know why but that is my experience and for the moment have not encountered any issues with Norton Sure all the mentioned antivirus perform admirably but I dont like when antivirus software will compromise my PC speed So if you are interested in Norton Antivirus 2014 with 180 day free product key just go HERE   and follow simple and easy instructions Enjoy 

    the term is Regardless not irregardless because the ir and the less would cancel each other out which makes it devoid of meaning however the article and the information itself seems accurate and goes into full detail for maximum satisfaction along with some humour and discusses in detail the upsides and the downsides so allinall very satisfying 

    David Rosen To elaborate about BitDefender I strongly believe that for the average unsophisticated users who dont want to have to answer any questions nothing beats BitDefender Free It does do scheduled scans  it just doesnt give you the choice of when to schedule them And it includes a good Web Sheld just like Avasts 

    The criticism in the article about BitDefender blocking something without asking is mainly a concern for the knowledgeable user like most of us leaving comments here This will rarely be a problem in practice for the unsophisticated user who anyway isnt really qualified by themselves to determine that the file is safe and that BitDefender is wrong At least they can report it to BitDefender and hopefully the false positive will stop in an upcoming definition update which of course would be an unacceptable delay for people like us who know what were doing  

    In any case being a sophisticated user I dont use BitDefender Free myself I use ZoneAlarm Free with its Kaspersky engine as my primary av I use Avast Free as a secondary av by using the installation options of Avast so as to not even install its realtime protection except its Web Shield feature since ZoneAlarm doesnt have this Thus most things get scanned twice once by Avasts Web Shield during the download and a second time by ZAs Kaspersky engine when the file is written to the filesystem 

    As far as false positives are concerned every antivirus suffers from the drawback So it is incorrect to say that this is aviras problem In recent past it is the other antiviruses which are suffering from this drawback more than avira Check File Detection Tests at avcomparativesorg for the last couple of years  carefully look at FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS You will have no reason to pin point Avira Other Antiviruses are worse 

    Nag screens in Avira are a past I dont see them anymore On rare occasions I do see some message about Avira Internet Security near the Avira icon in the system tray which I dont find intrusive at all but acceptable 

    BearPup Like you I was an Avast user for many years aprox 12 yrs until a few months ago I stopped using it for similar reasons Plus I didnt like the direction they were going etc But for me the final straw was something really small I had a small legacy software on my pc which I have had almost as long as Id been using Avast Then for some reason Avast suddenly decided that it was a virus and would automatically move it to the chest Didnt matter what I tried to prevent it with Avast it still kept doing it That was when I decided it was time to get rid of it 

    Ive tried many but settled on ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus It uses the Kaspersky antivirus engine Kaspersky always gets topnotch marks in testing Also it comes with a very good twoway firewall that doesnt constantly prompt you like some others It does display the occasional ad not every day unlike AvastBitdefenderMSE 

    Though admittedly risky I also install Avast Free with no realtime features except the Web Shield alongside ZoneAlarm Free This gives an independent first layer of protection for web browsing without additional performance impact since it scans during the download rather than after I also schedule ondemand or screensaver scans in Avast When installing two avs like this I minimize potential conflicts by going into both avs and disabling their selfprotection features and also whitelisting one anothers scanners so one wont flag the actions of the other 

    Ive been using Avira Free for many years and recommending it to others The adverts can be mildly annoying but its a small price to pay for the excellent antivirus performance and protect it provides Thanks for all the work and sharing the information with us 

    David Roper What a delicious vision that conjures up Brilliant David Personal testaments are what count though direct experience of a product over a long period always outweighs any third party test result  weve all seen enough over the years of allegedly independent reviews and allegedly flawless test protocols to know theyre as rare as snowballs in the Sahara 

    An observation that I consider important We often read I use the antivirus XXX and I have never had an infection I am always curious to know if heshe has never had infections as heshe never bumped into them or as the antivirus blocked them Nobody specifies it In the first case its luck only therefore the matter is irrelevant and the antivirus has not credit In the second case antivirus XXX deserves to be took into consideration 

    Its my life and I and I alone choose who gets to look at my personal information and that list is damn small Avast violated that approach and thats why I dropped them after years of usage So far AVG has asked for and taken nothing Thats the way it should be and as long as they stick to that regimen well get along just fine 

    I have been using Avast Free for years Along with Malwarebytes Pro and SuperAntiSpyware Pro and I have never had an infection as far back as I can remember If a web page is blocked because of suspicious activity then stay away If you are worried about Avast looking at your personal information but use Google then your information is being collected anyway I remember when everybody was up in arms about Google collecting personal information but most people still use Google anyway Why Because they are the best at what they do So for the same reasons I still use Avast Free They are the best at what they do IMO 

Hello All with a special nod to Ashraf for the ongoing analysis of free and effective Based in part on Ashrafs articles and other reviews as well I had no problem in selecting a new AV application    I had been a confirmed Avast Free user for many years until last November when they made some changes to their Code which put Avast in control of my computer and when they refused to talk about it with myself and others I elected to walk to a competitive company AVG So far Ive been impressed and have received 3 warnings about malicious files in just the first few days of operation 

    For a fuller explanation of the events leading to my switch see Comment 406 in this log I made my choices based on actual usage of the software and behavior of the company behind the software so far Im very satisfied with my choices 

    Ashraf Just a suggestion Im wondering if the reference solely to avast in the following linked and older article needs to be updated Not only that the linked article recommends as alternatives AVG and MSEboth of which are no longer among the best ranking products  

    Now a side comment Over the past year I have grown to trust what I read on dottech and Shareware On Sale Trust is hardearned particularly in the shadowy world of the internet From what Ive observed integrity and honesty are guiding principles in what you write and in the business you conduct In the long run you cant go wrong sticking with those principles 

    Thank you for the extensive article I have been using Microsoft Security Essentials for years now and I havent had any problems In the past Ive used other free and paid programs the latest paid being NOD32 and I havent seen any difference at all except no subscription charge I use a router for my computers so maybe that is good insurance 

    I use Avast Free on my Win7 older pc and have for years and no infections and actually no performance issues with it I am now using Trend Micro Antivirus with Win 81 Pro since it was included as a Bonus with the pc purchase In the first few months I lost out on a lot of good programs because it flagged the exe file as malicious but through forums I determined it to most likely false positives Since updating to the 2014 version of Trend Micro I am not seeing these false positives with installs so looks like this has been worked out with them Actually Trend Micro Antivirus is a good one and I would like to see them included in the review sometime Thanks Ashraf for all your reviews I find myself coming here often for advice not only from your reviews but from the other users opinions having more knowledge on these matters than I do Im still in the earlylearning phase and need all the help I can get Thanks to all for the unbiased opinions 

    I think Qihoo 360 deserves consideration among the top free antiviruses based on some very impressive outcomes I hope more of the testers will be including Qihoo and Comodo in the future so they can be brought into this comparison next time 

    ii Nothing changes more quickly than AV software reputation As this the 4th edition of the dot tech AV analysis renders its predecessors obsolete Im wondering if the earlier 400 posts relating to those predecessors can be moved off this comment thread and archived Its awkward  misleading to see this current page beginning with a post from April 2013 could not this 4th Edition report of February 2014 have its own feedback thread 

    iii The caveats issued in Ashrafs article are well worth noting and especially in regard to the fallibility of even the most wellrespected test labs That fallibility  no lets be blunt about it that sheer unreliability  is at its most evident in the Computer Impact results as scored by AVC and PC Mark where the outcomes for Panda Cloud are  in my extensive personal experience of this AV  absolute rubbish 

    The key phrase there is extensive personal experience The kind of experience that only individual AV users develop that only individual dot tech readers develop not in some test lab somewhere or other over a week or two but in their homes over periods of months and years 

    For which reason the true value of this 4th edition analysis resides not in its existence as a definitive reference resource but as a catalyst for responses from other dot tech readers of which my response  that the PC Impact results for Panda Cloud are so downright laughable that every other result in that particular panel is open to question  is but one 

    Nothing in this 4th edition of the dot tech analysis gives me any reason to change from the lightest and least intrusive AV of em all an outstanding invisible fortification from Panda that interlocks perfectly with Malwarebytes PRO and WinPatrol PRO all three of em always running simultaneously on my computer   and without the slightest performance impairment 

    Thank you for the work and review Ive been using Panda Cloud Free on my Win7 rig for a couple of years now Reasonably satisfied Thought Id mention that they have recently announced a beta version of what will apparently include substantive changes to theirfrom how it looks to how it performs  

    Flyfisher Emisisoft Anti Malware isnt free so it was never considered for this review True it has a freeware version but the freeware version has no live protection so it is relegated to second line of defense along with Malwarebytes and not a main anti virus in my book 

    Thanks Ashraf very comprehensive once again Ive been using avast Free for years now  am not disappointed Its lightweight  nonintrusive so I always install it on older systems I work on for friends  family I used to work for the largest US reseller of NOD32  also used to use Kaspersky however for avast cant be beat for free 

    Laura Comodo Internet Security PremiumI use it and I like it It has everything free firewall antivirus antimalware etc Fast easy to use powerful Fast update  I have tried all all all free antivirus and some paid and finally ended up with it Just give it a try 

    Mardel53 Ill add to your paranoia its why I just switched from Avast to AVG 1 year free trial still available  sharwareonsalecom On November 23rd 2013 Avast issued an Emergency Update that required the user to actuate this Update every time they rebooted their computer 

    Despite 6 pages of commenters asking for clarification and trying to separate fact from fiction Avast has been completely silent its been 2 days and counting Another of their tricks requiring users to opt out of providing free advertising for Avast How By turning on by default a tag line message placed at the bottom of each mail or other user communication that that communication has been protected by Avast 

    Ive been running Panda Cloud AV for quite a while now teamed with Malwarebytes and WinPattrol All three sit happily together Panda has recently undergone a major transformation resulting in four major upgrades on a daily basis  massively frustrating seeing as how the computer had to be rebooted immediately after every one But it has now settled down again with silent automatic updates I opted for Panda Cloud precisely because of that when Im travelling by car I dont want my enjoyment of the moment intruded upon by noise from engine exhaust or tires Same with AV Panda runs silentlly lightly and nonintrusively Since putting the PandaMBAMWinPatrol trio together Ive had no infections of any kind and so far as its possible to tell not a single false positive I occasionally run a BitDefender clickandgo online scan the BitDefender scan is installed as a simple Firefox addon and for greater depth Trend Micro Housecall online The one scanner Id strongly advise everyone to stay well clear of is HitmanPRO It claims high accuracy by drawing upon three separate AV resources and is available free of charge for up to 15 days just enter your email address into the activation box and thats it Or so youre led to believe A friend recently ran a free HitmanPRO online scan It identified several threats and one actual infection When he clicked next to deal with the problems HitmanPRO told him to activate or register with his license code He attempted to activate the 15day free period by entering in his email address but that failed to work HitmanPRO said his activation period had expired  even though it hadnt even started Curious to see what was going on myself and a colleague checked out HitmanPROs ostensible free activation We spent time downloading and scanning  and in my case encountering a spectacular false positive in the form of a Trojan allegedly buried in winpatrolexe  but neither of us were ever able to qualify for the free offer despite using a wide number of email addresses including several we made up on the spot All that HitmanPRO did was replicate the behaviour of typical scareware claim to find all kinds of stuff wrong on a computer and then when the user tries to act on that information say that money has to be paid before any cleanup can begin 

     As to Mardel53s query if Avast is sharing with 3rd parties personal or user behavioural data without the consent of the user then its surely time to say goodbye to Avast I have happy memories of it when it was much less bloated than it is now  and much less impressed with itself too 

    Ashraf I am curious to know what comments you may have regarding the latest warning in upgrading the free avast program to the newest version I get a warning that they now monitor the software and collect information and may share it with 3rd parties They claim they wont give out personal information Not knowing if the other free anti virus programs do this without telling you I am now curious if I should upgrade with avast or go with another anti virus 

There is a special page on AVComparatives where you can get a complete awards overview for all the habitually listed antiviruses The address of this page is      You may get the data for different categories like AntiPhishing Test FileDetection Test etc over a certain number of years All you have to do is to chose a category at the top of the table and after that you click on the antivirus of your choice on the right of the table 

    Im having an off day here In fact I just cant get on with it Or Im having an on day and cant get off with it Or or or   Thanks for highlighting my inability to type two simple letters please take it that yes that which I said was off is in fact on and why I went off track and typed off when I meant on must mean Im on something but Ive no idea what it can be Red wine seems like But Ill check for malware in my supper tray too   

     Sputnik hi sputnik thanks for that Re File Shield which I said was off but is on and shouldve read on not off Ive just tried to explain to dear Ashraf but failed I cant face the prospect of another embarrassing failure here So just to clarify the File Shield is ON and my brain is OFF and may very well have been all day 

    When you say about BitDefender Free  the way things have gone today and the sheer timewasting involved has left me unwilling to go near that developer ever again  regardless of how well it seems to do in AV comparison tests its your full right to think like this I will never say that you are wrong  this is simply a personal matter 

    Personally even if I am an old Avira fan I use their freeware version since about 6 years I will not say that I will never use BitDefender Free  if BitDefender brings a couple of changes to their free antivirus and if they correct all the little initial problems maybe I will use it instead of Avira Free 

    Concerning the problem that one of your friends had with the Raymonds solution about the Asks toolbar I must admit that I also had about the same problems at the beginning but I have finally solved these problems Concerning the reg file  when I downloaded this file this one came with a txt extension which I only change to reg and that solved the problem 

    I also understood that you must first uninstall Avira Free before merging the previous reg file and installing again Avira Free Some people will surely find this solution very fastidious but it just took me about 5 minutes to do the whole thing 

    Concerning the exact configuration you choose for Avast so to avoid a slowing down of your system I would suggest to you to go at the Avasts forum to talk about it with other Avasts users so to have their opinion about it Dont take only one opinion but wait till you will have received a couple  after that make your own mind on it 

    Just before sending this actual comment I saw that Ashraf send you a comment about the File Shield I was thinking exactly the same and thats why I suggested to you to go to Avasts forum You should really go there anyway 

    MikeR File Shield is one of those you dont want to turn off From what I understand that is your live protection against malicious files  the stuff that is traditionally thought about as antivirus protection 

    Hi Sputnik Yup my BitDefender AV Free experience has proved not to have lived up to expectations the way things have gone today and the sheer timewasting involved has left me unwilling to go near that developer ever again  regardless of how well it seems to do in AV comparison tests 

    I note your points about Avira and yes youre absolutely correct  when I had Avira I finished up using a workaround to get rid of the nag screens And a few months ago Raymond published on his website a link to the Avira Ask Toolbar registry fix although when a friend of mine downloaded it the reg file wouldnt merge nor could he import it  I dont know what went wrong there 

    Avast I always favoured but dumped because it was absolutely definitely and without a shadow of a doubt slowing my system to a crawl on too many occasions Today however Ive reluctantly gone back to it because I knew how good it was as an AV not as bloatware and this time have run a custom install to stop the sheer pileup on this machine of so many shields that Im so weighed down with armourplating that nothing can move 

    File Shield NO Mail Shield NO Web Shield YES P2P Shield YES IM Shield NO Network Shield YES Script Shield YES Behavior Shield NO Browser protection YES avast gadget YES avast remote assistance YES Browser cleanup YES Software Updater NO 

    Also running is Malwarebytes PRO but note I dont run MBAM PRO all the time as it proved to be as great an impediment to this computers performance as Avast did in its former guise and finally WinPatrol PRO is also running at the same time too Thats four defence systems in place representing rather more than a mere four layers of protection 

    Finally   although I have the darnnear essential Sandboxie installed I dont run it all the time but if  when I come across something I think Id like to download and try then I switch to the SandboxieFirefox browser and DL and install and play with there  not a security consideration I know but an indication of how this computer operates to avoid crap programs and apps as well as malware Quite why anyone who uses for example giveawayoftheday opr bits du jour without sandboxing the downloads escapes me but thats by the by  in fact with bdj its just about mandatory 

    Im going to run this setup for a few days and see what happens Its pretty much brand new really seeing as how Online Armor Free was only installed yesterday Fingers crossed that all of them now play nicely together  which BitDefender AV Free certainly seemed to be doing until todays developermishandled problems 

    But concerning Avira Free I will just say that you can easily get rid of the nag screen with a very simple manipulation and also you may get the Web Protection module without the need of installing the Asks toolbar with another simple manipulation 

    Concerning the serious update glitch in 2010 which it consistently and repeatedly refused to acknowledge and also in view of its nauseating behavior in teaming up with Ask and trying to finesse the entire toolbar issue even in its own user forums I will agree with you that this is something which is clearly hurting many people 

    Personally as I have solved the problems of the nag screen and the Asks toolbar and as I personnally never had serious problems with Avira and that it has always well protected my computer agains threats I am still sticking to this antivirus according to the fact that this is a very personal matter 

    Note that even if a manufacturer of antivirus should eventually have better business practices than that of Avira this is not a warranty that you will not have any problem at all with their antivirus solution as this is the case for you with BitDefender Free 

    Hi Sputnik Ill steer clear of the discussion you and ovl had on the other thread All I will say is that BitDefender AV Free editioin today hit some kind of problem that evidently affected a large number of users worldwide The developer seems not to have managed the issue at all well seeing as there are complaints about lack of communication on BitDefenders own forum and there even appears to be a continuing confusion as to whether the problem has been fixed anyway 

    As to Avira well one lives according to ones experience and after Avira failed consistently thanks to a serious update glitch in 2010 which it consistently and repeatedly refused to acknowledge until the time came when it er finally had to and after all the nag screens and in view of its nauseating behavior in teaming up with Ask and trying to finesse the entire toolbar issue even in its own user forums   thanks but no thanks I wouldnt go within a country mile of Avira free or paidfor 

    In this thread a certain ovl extolled the merits of this recent new version of BitDefender Free which has an active shield against viruses and he was saying something like that this was the best free antivirus on the market 

    But if we now follow its own logic the one from its comment 50 on the thread Ive just spoke about where he was saying that Avira was not a good antivirus maker because they had a problem at a certain moment with their paid version we must now conclude that BitDefender Free must be dumped right now by everyone who use it because its now proven that it is only a piece of st 

    Because BitDefender was still a relatively new product thats why I said in my comment 62  If this is the case I think it would be a good thing to wait for the surely upcoming reports on this new version before using it as our main antivirus solution 

    Its a good thing from your part MikeR that you uninstalled BitDefender Free for installing Avast Free an antivirus which made its proofs If Avast is slowing down your system at certain times you should at this moment consider to use Avira Free 

    Following the discussion on the other thread about firewalls  where BitDefender AV Free was mentioned  I decided to install it Last week I was very impressed with it it seemed light and effective Yesterday I installed Online Armor Free Edition No problems And it looks impressive Both firewall and AV appeared to play nicely 

    I spent a couple of hours this morning messing around using the BitDefender Free repair which didnt work and an uninstall and then a fresh install That effort achieved nothing BitDefender AV Free isnt functioning 

    I now discover late in the day that the developers of BitDefender AV Free posted on the user forum at around 10am UK time today that a problem is affecting it resulting in error messages and dmp files which users are invited to upload for analysis but not if youre running the Free version which has no Support backup 

    The problem isnt specified Users are apparently expected to er   wait Users are told that BitDefender AV Free is actually functioning  despite the fact that on my computer it repeatedly warns that it is not That there is no antivirus defence 

    Ive just uninstalled it and installed Avast Free The development team behind the BitDefender AV Free edition clearly have some way to go in maturing this product if its taking them all day to sort out a fix Note though the developer is insisting today that only the Free edition is affected other users are reporting that the registered licensed commercial version is also affected 

    I must confess that I am an old fan of Avira which I use since 6 or 7 years I think I have always been well protected with it its impact on the system has always been minimal there is a good bunch of options available and as long as things will go this way I will stick to this very good antivirus 

    That said I have absolutely no problems at all in face of persons who would say they prefer another antivirus  it is a matter of taste and as is its a kind of personal point of view I also have no problems about discussing with respect with someone who doesnt share the same point of view than mine 

    Other aspects may come into consideration on daily use After thoroughly experimenting all three Avira Avast AVG on realtime protection I personally fixed my choice on the theoretically lesser performer AVG Simply because Avira would consistently block some current executable programs dictionaries etc and Avast would turn my computer into an awfully slow machine 

    This post is semi related anti virus protection I browsed Comodos other free programs We can download Comodo IceDragon which is based on FF but has some extra Comodo security built into the browser AND during the Install you can elect to make it a PORTABLE program I did Ashraf you might care to post this on your other threads where DotTechies were desiring portable FF Rob PS Comodo also has a Chrome based version Chrome will never darken my PC door step again 

    Carl Ashraf and Gizmo both have something in common  Neither of them mentioned Comodo Gizmo does have a separate very brief page where he says  can be somewhat intrusive when first installed Did you find that  How intrusive is it now for you  Are you using all its features Firewall Antivirus etc  What have you disabled or avoided  Do you have a link to a comprehensive review  How good is its antivirus detection  Are you using any other security at the same time  Have you turned off your Windows firewall  What version of Windows are you running  

    I am fixing up a laptop for a friend Win 7 Pro It does not have an anti virus I am using Avast on my XP PCs and had serious trouble some time ago when there was a major program update Not latest but the previous Program version jump I notice on Gizmo there are a couple of comments concerned about Avast and now some concerns about Avira are being raised Those of you using Win 7 Pro and either of those two free programs which would you recommend for gentleness to our Win 7 Pro system  Avira or Avast  

    I found the people at MicroAge Laval to be very helpful Especially for big businesses that have a lot of information to protect Its a little more intense than just downloading a simple virus removal program This company will consult you with different options depending on how your business is structured They also helped up set up our printer 

    I really dont find this analyze too trustworthy Firstly you use different versions in all tests many of which are clearly outdated and in some you even use payversions Furthermore it should be mentioned that any ASKpowered toolbar is not recomended as an install as it tend to include unpleasant visitors 

    well saidi am also using MSE and i m very satisfied as it does not sucks or slow down speedpreviously i have been using MCAFEE licensed but i was not satisfiedas it slows down my computer and not up to desired standardMSE is best who has a licensed Windows OS and using upto date browserspending dollars is meaningless 

    I run Windows 7  64bit and AVG and MSE in conjunction with each other a very effective combination MSE  AVG run side by side and do not conflict with each other and allow me to get on with my work and HOPE FOR THE BEST  

    Used to use AVG Read Avira was better Got rid of Avira because of all the intrusive popups Tried MSE but when its RealTime Protection was running Start Menu icons took forever to load Ive got a lot of links in there Tried Avira again and it too took forever to load Start Menu icons 

    Theres newlyfree option Zone Alarm Free Antivirus and unlike the others it includes a firewall I tried it but I didnt like the firewall because it tied up about 100MB of memory The AV component is reputed to be supplied by Kaspersky whose products are rated highly 

    Ruffturn you could also try AVG or even Panda Cloud which both seem to be rated as more effective than MSE I didnt like Panda Cloud because it didnt appear to have an ondemand or scheduled scan feature  it was realtimeonly Also I have doubts about the cloud aspect where its highly dependent on its connectivity back to its servers to be fullyeffective 

    I installed Avira a week ago because I kept finding Avast turned off for some reason When I tried to upgrade to a newer version Avast 70 it failed to install and I had to find an uninstaller to get rid of it They knew they had a problem and instead of telling the users about it they let them find out and fend for themselves 

    That said I uninstalled Avira today because once per day I get a splash screen asking me to be a reseller I dont sell anything as it is Im surely not going to get into the antivirus business Next is the popups in the tray asking me to upgrade to the pay version or buy other products Avira is gone now too I have absolutely no idea if its a good AV program or not I dont want to be hounded all of the time 

CY AVG is free for personal and business usebut Avast has some more extra features which includes the behavior blocker p2p protection intelligent scanner network shield and chat protection     I have MSE and every single time I run a scan it finds a trojan win 32 MSE cleans the computer so why is it still there the next time I run a scan Sometimes I run a scan back to back so is it or isnt it cleaning my computer and ridding it of this trogan 

Hey Ashraf have you ever heard of AllinOne Secretmaker here is a link to it   Would like your or other readers 2 cents on it Thanks    I think its worth mentioning that most modern browser now offer anti phishing tools So I find Anti Virus programs not focusing on what is already covered I like MSE in terms of effective protection and in terms of it using limited resources As someone who believes a OS like Windows 7 and a modern browser up to date is more important then spending dollars on a Security suite I think any of the free Anti virus solutions will work well 

    Hello there just changed into aware of your weblog thru Google and found that its truly informative Im going to be careful for brussels I will appreciate if you proceed this in future A lot of other people shall be benefited out of your writing Cheers 

    If you look at two or three of the same sites consecutive iterations of the same report not to mention across different testing sites you draw very different conclusions about which products are better Is this because every few months different products pull way ahead of each other in effectiveness I doubt it Even if they do unless youre planning on installing a new product every few months you dont want to choose one solely because it got lucky on one particular test in the Quarter that you happened to buy it 

    Most of them dont even pretend to do any statistical tests to see what the margin of error is on their results or to see whether the difference between two products is just due to the random happenstance of exactly which set of malware they tested it against 

    More info about this problem Even I install AVAST it still happens In other words either MSSE or AVAST as antivirus program on this Windows 7 64 bit installation this Win 7 Antivirus virus can install itself as the antivirus program replacing either MSSE or AVAST originally installed It may be a security bug in Windows 7 how can any program install itself as the antivirus program without prompting the permission from the user Anyone has any similar experience or any suggestion Thanks CY 

    I installed MSE on my Windows 7 professional PC with the latest Virus update after 12 days on the web mainly Youtube it is infected with the Win 7 Antivirus Virus does anyone has such an experience Unfortunately for me I have made a disk image with Acronis True image I can recover my original clean installation But this has happened twice in the past 34 days Any suggestion what I should do to protect my PC what if I install Avira or avast or AVG I appreciate any suggestions Thanks CY 

    acr Interesting I read that thread but I am not sure if it is possible to censor a web page like that ie you can visit the website bur it gives you a page not found It may have been some sort of bug Thanks for pointing it out 

    Cooper I got hit by several of these driveby attacks while using Avira and this is just purely from browsing That is why Ive opted to go with avast because I think a webguard is crucial for antivirus protection And using a Chromium browser because of its sandbox technology helps too 

    On another security topic interesting that I had Norton DNS installed and was not allowed access to an article that criticized a Norton program But I uninstalled Norton DNS and access was allowed See the link here  So is Norton censoring the web with its DNS filter 

    Ashraf Identity Protection is a behavior blocker It was formerly known as Sana Security Primary Response Safe Connect but Sana Security was bought out by Grisoft AVG Identity Protection is really an antibot program as that was its original purpose AVG renamed the Safe Connect program Identity Protection Also AVG used to sell IP as a stand alone program but no longer does 

    Panda Cloud is getting very big as they seem to continue to have very good detection rates in malware tests Panda Cloud also seems to be getting good reports across many of the security sites and blogs 

    greg bern Installing in Safe Mode is a good feature to have you are right it is useful to know which programs will do it Also you should look at rescue disks  almost all vendors provide bootable rescue disks for infected comps 

    When I used to use Avira a few years back it was known to have lots of false positives However based off the tests conducted Avira has few false positives so I couldnt legitimately say the tests say few but a couple years back it was like this 

    And you are right some of the tests are slightly dated although I disagree with the sentimental WAY outdated That is just the nature of the beast Impossible to have 100 updatetodate test results simply because of how quickly software is being updated 

    1 AVAST has annoying file footprint databasewhich breaks and takes long to run but is necessary 2 Runs in DOS Mode Why needed 3 Has no boot disk for antivirus 4 Antivir has boot disk  you must remake it daily to be current 5 AVG has Surf protector autoupdating boot disk annoying popups telling of updates many falsepositives despite an Exceptions List 6 See  for most current info on viri 

    Recently while looking for a page to watch a specific new tv show episode from abroad I got taken over by Windows 7 AntiVirus 2012 a malware which hijacked my IE9  stopped me from doing much else than continually viewing fake alerts to convince me to purchase their product I stopped it in its tracks  used everything at my disposal from Spypot to Spyware Doctor  AdAware etc back to MSE they cleaned everything out My IE9 is kaput  thoroughly unsavable 

    BUT shouldnt MSE have stopped it in its tracks in the 1st place when I keep it updated  fully functional on a daily basis My trip to webpages did not include ANY downloading of programs but hijacked I was  IE9 is dead 

    Im running MSE 4011110 which is in beta soon to be final flawlessly on a Windows 7 Ultimate system I download and test lots of software lots of which is crap Instant virus detection by MSE never infected These test results are WAY out of date and shouldnt be useful as a guide to the current AV versions Thats always the problem with software test sites  software is updated too frequently that by the time tests are published they are out of date Comodo free firewall provides a super extra level of protection  I highly recommend it 

    Thanks for the update Ashraf btw love this site I know your not suppose to run more than one antivirus program but Im running 3 Doesnt look like I have any issues but who knows Im running Windows 7 64 with 6 gigs of ram Using Avast MSE and Panda Cloud with Comodo Firewall 

    When I got my first PC a Tandy from Radio Shack in the late 80s I never heard of a computer virus so it wasnt until I bought my first Windows machine in the mid90s that I even had an av McAfee of course Over the years I have used many av products but avast is what I have settled on for the past several What I like best about avast is that it just sits there and does the job it is supposed to do without calling attention to itself If not for the popup I see when it updates I think I would forget it was there 

    In my experience Avira is horrible at false positives thats mostly why theyre so good at false negatives MSE and AVG somewhat but not much better In fact Avast and the payware Nod32 are the only reliable products for false positives Basically if Avast tells you something is infected youd better believe it 

    Are all equal in system impact Not in my experience Aside from qualitative observations about sluggishness not at all with Avast and MSE noticeable with Avira  AVG there are also issues with stability on my systems Although none of these products are as bad as Norton or Kaspersky I have had too many problems with Avira to try it again 

    Bottomline for years I roamed between the payware and freeware antimalware solutions burdening my system with all manner of AV antispyware behavior blockers and firewallsAND being completely disturbed by their performance both in effectiveness and system impact 

    Just about 1 year ago I did 3 things I dualbooted Linux  Win 7 after using both I find myself relying on Linux more and more BUT I still use Win 7 quite a bit Second I dumped ALL security software on Win 7 and installed Avast Free that plus a router is ALL that I need everything is faster and easier and Ive remained virusfree Third I stopped using registry cleaners 

    The result of this is that Ive not had to restore my Win 7 system via a Paragon image backup in over a year Prior to that I was restoring it at least every month because something was always going wrong Mostly this has been due to staying away from registry cleaning but it also is due to Avast and how it is effective without ANY noticeable system impact 

    AVG 2012 should now include a behavior blocker Their Identity Protection has been incorporated into the free version The Identity Protection is essentially a white listing behavior monitor that flags potentially malicious activity of unknown programs but is probably the most advanced behavior blocker of all the free antivirus programs Im not sure if the behavior blocker in Avast is really fully featured at this time I believe it only logs what should be blocked but does not actually block anything unless this has been added recently 

    Panda free version probably deserves mention as well with these other four The free av market is starting to open back up There are free avs with the VIPRE engine and signatures and some with the Bitdefender engine  sigs but thats not in any English GUI I think the free avs you have mentioned plus Panda are still a ways ahead of the rest of the free av programs available 

    Antonio Try Windows Firewall Notifier  Its a free little tool that blocks any connection unless you allow it It is based on the Windows firewall so it doesnt consume much resource Its an excellent idea but I have noticed that sometimes it forgets previously allowed connections and it may become too intrusive 

    I am trying to install in safe mode on infected comp and mse want work in safe mode avira does and avast I think will  so if no av and infected this tip could help Ease of use is mse as avg is complicated and trying to get you to upgrade to more 

    Generally no But there are a few such as Malwarebytes Free that are somewhat recommended alongside another My general rule has been only one real time scanner active at a time the other installed to not be real time Otherwise they can conflict not to mention the system slowdown from two realtime scans going 

    Nice comparison really all the products are freeware I quite dont like Avast  on one occasion it detected an autoruninf virus on my pendrive and later removed it but when i inserted it back it still detected autoruninf virus  

    That PC was on a webcafe i sat where as AVG later detected and removed it But i still quite dont like it my friend uses AVG on all his PC he too runs Webcafe shop and although his PC is terribly slow due to AVG but some of his rig are old with single core processors it still protects and cleans viruses 

    For me i was using Nortn Antivirus 2010 with a paid license and on one occassion my external HDD got a nasty malare or a trojan virus and it later infected my home pc too Norton wasnt too helpful  i had bought Norton just 2 weeks back But those Malware and Trojan was removed by Microsoft Security Essential which one of my other friend had it on his PC 

I have alwaus used AVG until discovering that 2011 slows down computers It has been ok on my laptop but stuffed my partners computer Am currently downloading Avast to try on both our computers    Id rather choose microsoft security essentials the avast even i upgraded it to internet security it fails to detect the test viruses i try to install to my pc while the MSE upon downloading it detects the virus and clean it its a waste of money to buy the paid version as if the detection is not good but more functions on avast internet security though 

    Hey can anyone suggest firewall software that alerts the user when something wants to connect to the Internet I remember having something called maybe Checkpoint Firewall a while back but I cant find it Zonealarm is another that comes to mind Im trying to find an all in one AV suite with this Firewall feature 

    The problem with this report is it picked one snapshot in time almost a year ago now and draws conclusions from that MSE has never scored very well on heuristic tests in the past and it is not scoring well again in the latest tests Yet here you all are claiming to feel safe 

Basically every system tested gets 9599 of on demand scans where they have time to send an updated pattern No statistical difference BIG WARNING Ive been using avast and avira different systems and AVAST has pulled out of the latest tests over at avcomparatives This scares the heck out of me We need to demand they get back in    After trying MSE I switched back to AVG MSE failed to stop BitCom Defender fake antivirus something AVG caught stopped and removed before it managed to infect anything How MSE has a higher rating for real time virus threats is a mystery 

    I trust antiviruscomparatives and right now MSE is second to Mcafee in false positives detection in fact you can strip every AV out there and if you were to compare them all on simply the basis of false positives none of them win 

    Jack Frost I think you make a good point but it should be noted that in the AVComparatives ProactiveRetrospective review only the products heuristicgeneric detections were tested Its my understanding that the paid and free versions of AVG and Avira have the same scanning engines and receive the same signature updates Further I believe the scanners of each at the highest settings are the same If that is the case which I believe it is then the detections abilities in this particular type of test should be nearly identical Maybe the only difference would be the paid versions of AVG and Avira may have more frequent default updates which could effect the available signatures in the product at the time of the scan But I am not sure of the updates issue as I dont have either product installed as of now 

    As far as the on demand detection tests of AVComparatives I dont believe any of the malware is executed in the testing just scanned in its static state So the above would apply here as well Avira Avast MSE and AVG have behavior type monitors in their products although I believe Avira only has its ProActive detection in its paid product But most of the behavior monitors and proactive features of even the paid products are still in their relative infancy in regards to being able to detect malware AVGs is most likely the most advanced But AVG discreetly does not make public that their behavior monitor called Identity Protection is also included in its free version But anyway if the detection tests do not have malware which is executed and running the behavior monitoring components wont matter in the results 

    I own a laptop with had installed Avira with it running I got a crash I had to reinstall my operating system to fix Since I have installed Avast no more problems The real issues come when using peer to peer programs It is not enough to scan for viruses the new downloaded files I got the crash even after the scan Avast offer a feature called sandbox that is able to run the scanned application in order to test if it threatens your cmputer so only after having tested it you may trust about its use 

    I have used all of these programs currently or in the past AVG no longer impresses me with the pestering to upgrade to paid versions and the discontinuing some free features Avira Free is not proactive so its kinda limited at this time 

    Avast is a great product with an annoying annual registration and a strange looking interface MSE to my surprise has turned out to be a terrific product that actually surpasses every free protection suite out there Other 

    Ashraf after reading this article all the way through Im not too impressed with you Youve republished someone elses research albeit with his permission which compares the paid versions of Avira and AVG with the free versions of avast and MSE  and youve totally hidden and disguised the fact that the comparison is not between free sofware all round The headline is deceptive and so is the first 80 of the article It would have been far more helpful of you to provide an honest summary making it clear that the research youve borrowed does not provide a basis for deciding between free security solutions 

    You can get a years subscription of Avira AntiVir Premium through TrialpayBasically you sign up for one of the offers and once your order is confirmed you get emailed download instructions for the software and a serialkeyThen if you are like me you immediately cancel your months freethough not always subscription and you have legit software for a year for freeI have done this with other software and most of the offers even if you have to pay for a month of it is still a lot cheaper than the software you get for free Additional informationIf you want to play with AutoDesk products apparently they do not like AvastI was advised to uninstall Avastinstall AutoDesk AutoCad then Reinstall AvastAlso if you are a student or unemployed you are eligible for a free 13 month licence to use upto 30 AutoDesk productsSearch their site for a link to the Autodesk Assistance Program section and good luck 

    I am thinking of possibly using Avira AntiVir Personal Free Antivirus Could somebody please tell me does it require registration to use it Ive read that Avast requires registration but Im not sure about Avira 

    this is only one of good research however for personal use pc  paid antiviruses or spyware is look like powerfull and can protect user from any kind of attack the fact is none of antivirus or spyware can fully protect your pc almost 20 years research for all kind antivirus we never can find sucessfull virus removal advise for all  never use any paid antivirus never buy any spyware use free antivirusspyware but always change your antivirus in a year every release antivirus only can protect your pc older virus how many people not infected by virus even they install antiviruses none clear your mind and think more you pay for antivirus more virus you will get 

    First time to this site from GOTD link Awesome site Will definitely return Thank you for a great site Please consider reviewing Ashampoos Antimalware  not a free program but worthy of consideration and I would like to get your opinion on it Seems very nice but Im just a user not an expert This particular page post was excellent 

Johnd I cant speak for the others but Microsoft Security Essentials gives you a choice to ignore quarantine or destroy It also of course shows the malwarevirus threat level low medium high    Giovanni Did you read  The detection rate is on par with all the other AVs tested and it only barely stoops to Avira Also who cares about email protection I dont know anyone who uses a desktop email client outside of the work environment only webmail For that only proactive scanners will work Lastly antiphishing is built into Firefox Chrome even Internet Explorer So everything considered I think that MSE could be good as PROACTIVE MALWARE and PROACTIVE ANTIVIRUS SCANNER along with well nothing 

I think the behavior blocker area for Avast needs an  as the behavior blocker is not yet truly part of the protection in the antivirus See this link for the upcoming release of version 51     The Behavior Shield functionality is still incomplete in this build And even in the final v51 it will work only in passive mode which means that the new sensors will be active but wont be stopping the attacks just reporting them to our backend infrastructure unless you have opted out from the avast community membership This is to allow us to collect enough data before enabling the real thing in Q1 2011 

    I think it may give users a false sense of security to believe there is actually a proactive behavior blocker that alerts users in Avast I believe in time there will certainly be a behavior blocker available that will alert users as Avast is a high quality product But for now the behavior blocker area for Avast needs to be qualified with an  Just my 2 cents worth 

    John I have both Advanced System Care and Avast installed  but have never had a problem like what you describe However I had Avast ver4 installed first then installed Advanced System Care I have since upgraded to avast ver 5 and I must say I am vvery happy with both programs and i can say that Avast detects and blocks threats BEFORE they enter your system I do check very carefully the changes that Advanced System Care makes to my system Everyone can not have the same configuration on thier system  so Advanced System Care can sometimes change things that will not benifit you in your situation but so far I have had excellent results from both Avast and Advanced System Care  The only gripes i have with Avast are this 1 The default setting for automatic virus pattern updates is set to check for updates every 72 min as i recall True there do seem to be new updates that are available every 72 min but that is a little extreme in my opinion unless you spend all day on the internet of course The setting can be changed pretty easy so its not a huge issue How to change it click on the avast icon in the system tray at the top tool bar click Settings on the left side menu click Updates click the Details dropdown menu at the bottom then you cn change the number in the AutoUpdate Interval field in minutes I use 4300about 3 days  Right above that you may choose to disable the notification pop up box if you wish 2 In version 4 you were able to do url blocking with wildcard patterns I used this very successfully for ad blocking ecample swebinformercom blocks all files from swebinformercom  doubleclick blocks any domain that contains doubleclick like googleadsgdoubleclicknet or doubleclickmecom In version 5 this feature is not included as far as i can tell In the past 2 years i can say that I have never had a problem with a virus  trojan or malware of any sort Also never had a false positive I am a regular user at givawayoftheday as i imagine many of you are as well I had used Trend micro pccillin for a long time with limited success I then tried AVG but lost it with my old system when I had virus corruption that AVG could not clean or fix I tried Avast and was amazed at the real time features and how it did not lag my system My vote is for Avast 

    John holy crap as far as i know advanced system care is a very good SW recommended by Ashraf but this would freak me out for sure glad that i never installed it in my new computer Janet i second you no more nag screen of avira Pandora well at least you are getting an AVAS from a company for free who makes the OS and that makes me feel that it should work better 

Ashraf I think I incorrectly made my previous post Here is a link to the info about Identity Protection in AVG free version     One point on latest review  For both tests Microsoft Security Essentials had very few false positives which is very impressive Once again I have to give kudos to Microsoft for this Personally I dont see this a plus point especially given the relatively low detection rates  why If say you have 100 baduns AV1 ids 98 but ones a false ve oops AV2 ids 80 but no false ve  great stats but it missed 1718 real threats I would rather get toldhave blocked a false ve and have to research myself than let through a real nasty or 10 If you push to the limit occaisionaly you will overstep the line If you stay a yard away from the edge you never fall off  And of course MSE comes from the evil empire should wind somebody up 

    I thought perhaps I should mention that since I got a new computer and installed Avira Free I have NO nag screens I do go through all Options thoroughlydont know if I checked something there that did itor perhaps they took to heart all the complaints 

    If you have installed on your PC the program Iobit Avanced System Care and you install Avast Antivirus you may not be able to surf the internet  why well as far as I can tell it is either Avast or its Iobit that changes your TCPstach and also changes Winsock under windows  several members of the Avast forum have noticed this and have post many commentes to this problem The only way to be able to surf the internet is to disable the  Webshild  however a solution has been found 

    Jyo i have no intention to hurt other OS users but windows users dont believe in security through obscurity it is clear that windows has a much broader spectrum of software and users than any other OS in the market and therefore dealing with security is tricky it is also evident that free software are doing as good job as the paid ones for general users as they are all free we only look for effectiveness efficiency footprint and other features well currently these are my security software and observations  avast is my AV realtime protection is ON very nice except for its virus database has been updated audio comment and systemchoking run while scanning in my other laptop avira is good the nag screen stopped dont know why but somehow liked avast more influence of ashraf LOL  malwarebytes AS ondemand scan if i suspect something you cant go without this although rarely used by me but saved me many times  winpatrol ON the name tells you everything about it warns you if something is trying to install itself without your knowledge say yahoo toolbar well i find it kinda nagging as it warns me every time i installupdate a software i normally do custom install therefore winpatrol sounds redundant for me  keyscrambler ON saves you from keyloggers  linkextend ON talks about the safety of the sites  returnil OFF if i need to install an unknown software or visit an unknown site i turn virtual mode on and reboot after done you cant go wrong with this 

    Jim Van Damme Yes I do need more RAM But for the sake of the being light on resources argument Im just proving my point that MSE isnt as light as many are boasting about as least on xp do note this 512MB Ram pc isnt my only computer 

    And although I have used Linux I dont think users have to go to the extent of switching to Linux just for the sake of being more secure from malware  thats just overkill imho But thats not saying Linux is bad but telling average users to use Linux to be free from viruses is not very wise But like you said being careful definitely helps 

    Ashraf Well to solve the problem of backlinks you could include in the top of the articles a link to the most recent one As for the comments hmmm that one Im not as sure aboutthough we could all just subscribe to the new one 

    To be honest I didnt think about just creating a new post instead of updating my current one but it is a good idea The only problem is backlinks to this article are all over the Internet If I stop updating this and just create new posts the new visitors here may not understand that this article is outdated and there is a new article regarding the same issue 

    acr Are you 100 sure about the behavior monitoridentity protect in AVG Free Their website does not list such features but I will update the chart to reflect this if I can get some concrete proof No offense I am not calling you a liar or anything 

    Im not sure if this has been mentioned yet or not  but the latest AVG free antivirus includes a behavior monitor AVG included the Identity Protection although its not mentioned very well on the AVG web site AVG Identity Protection used to be a stand alone product as well but is no longer offered for sale in that regard Originally ID Protection was Sana Security Safe Connect but that company was purchased by AVG The product is also included in some Norton products as the Antibot protection 

    On the other hand the behavior monitor included in Avast is still in its relative infancy and is not really much more than the antirootkit monitor It is supposed to be enhanced in Avast version 51 Theres also expected to be a behavior monitor in Aviras next free version and MSE version 2 is supposed to have a behavior monitor as well MSE already includes heuristics and dynamic generic signatures 

Jim Van Damme You must be profoundly insecure to be Linux trolling in a review of software exclusively for Windows OS That youre extolling BeginUx Linux confirms the diagnosis Take a pill and move on    I always thought MSE wasnt as light as everyone was saying Sure its simple and since I am a Windows fanboy Im very proud of Microsofts achievement but installing MSE on my 512MB Ram PC from 4 years ago did not work out well at all Im still with Avira and I can say I wont be switching anytime soon unless some significant thing occurs 

    Until MSE was on the market I was installing AVG free but it was taking to much space and resources so I started to install to all my clients the MSE I use it too and it protect me well time to time it jump out telling me that some thing is wrong and need to be cleaned I install too another AV in parallel  Imunet AV   It work on real time from the cloud and can be use with other AV They timed with ClamAV an other free AV 

    all my avast is detecting autoruninf malware in my USB flash drive does anybody know whether its a false one or something i should take care of i really want to switch to MSSE better IMO as it is offered by the OS maker only and by now MSSE should be smart and competitive enough but dont know whether it will do as good job as avastavira 

    Jim Van Damme i think having silverlight is good as it actually helps to bring a new level of interactivity wherever the web worksgenuine advantage detects whether you are using a pirated OS or not and IMO it is their right to check before they offer you a free AV 

    The catregory of no advertising is misleading and unfair The only advertising Ive seen with Avast is an unintrusive ad on the opening menu screen Big deal Its a far cry from intrusive popups yet the chart does not reflect that 

    Surprise Microsoft installs Silverlight and Genuine Advantage along with SE So I go with Panda on Windoze machines The less Microsoft I use the happier I am which is why Im running Ubuntu right here  Although I think their mice are pretty good 

    I was happily using Avira free editon version 9 and then I upgraded to version 10 and then the problems began The most noticeable problem was a significant slowdown of the machine Using process hacker I could see that Avira would take 100 CPU time when I opened files I also noticed that its memory footprint was significantly larger On a less critical side of things the new user interface is IMO a step backwards the version 9 one was far better 

    Performance got so bad that I uninstalled Avira and downloaded Avast 5 Free edition So far I am happy with it although I find that it takes too long to find out if an update is required and sometimes these updates are large 

    BUT the biggest problem with Avast is that since downloading it I have since started to receive a lot of SPAM to the unique email address I used to register Avast  thats why I use unique email address for each piece of software I am not impressed at all so everyone should keep this fact in mind when registering Avast I have never received any SPAM to the Avira email address 

    FWIW the latest 102010 VB100 tests disagree with these results not only placing all 3 of these at about the same level of protection but among the best available in both proactive and reactive protection In fact AVG 2011 marginally outperformed both Avast  Avira IMHO any of these 3 are acceptable and while Ive never liked AVG in the past the new AVG 2011 is my current choice Its light on resources has minimal false positives very good detection and most of all has a terrific interface Combined with the free threatfire HIPS it has been completely troublefree 

    I am running both Avira and AVG on one computer and it seems that despite Avira running a daily scan AVG is picking up viruses left and right during a scan currently underway I will say that Avira is or seems to be the first to detect the virus as soon as its picked up however everything I go into My Computer it beeps and says that it blocks autorun because I always keep a game disc in my CD drive because I play the game constantly I also have been having issues updating Avira since What Avira is telling me 1111 of this year After looking at all of these graphs though I kind of want to try avast now 

    Between MS Security Essentials Avast AVG and Avira I have found that Avast causes the least payload to the system with a good detection rate Complement with MalwareBytes paid or not a good Firewall there are good free ones Virus Total Sandboxie paid or not and and you are good to go 

    Along with Avast    Try the Free Panda Cloud Antivirus which is not locally based in your computer but zaps malware from a server in the internet It catches the bad guys BEFORE it downloads into your computer 

    As a regular user I have try three of these antiviruses Agree that avast still serve a maximum protection It block a suspicious file before I open it AVG and Avira wont do that But I agree Avira has a fastest scanner engine Unfortunately doesnt have automatic healing of quarantine action AVG does but the virus scanner is slow 

    When I read about the professionalpaid version one of the reasons Avast has to upgrade is a Firewall You do not mention anything about a firewall in any of the three Do the free versions not have a firewall 

    I plan to use my home desktop Win 7 i5 only for playing games not connected to internet but CDDVDPDs will be used often Occasional movies MS office works will be done Which one then you recommend for me  

    I have a personal story to tell We got a NASTY virus on our work shipping computer Having just started up a side business cleaning up computers I decided to do it for free in return for experience gained I scanned that computer in safe mode with half a dozen scanners including Avast and AVG I have always picked Avast due to the boot scan option and will continue to use that in my cleaning process of peoples computers However I ran Avira after Avast boot scan and Avira came up with THREE more trojan horses and a two KillApp critters Just before scanning I called out a bounty to whoever could find the bug causing the problem yes I kinda talk to computers lol The program to find and solve the issue would become the program I install on my clients and my own computer After Avast missed 5 viruses I went with Avast Props to Avast for going above the call of duty with extras but slower scans and most important missing viruses gave him the close second to Avira Thank you SOO much for this article Those charts and tests REALLY gave me a visual confirmation to pick Avira 

    At one time I was using Avira free and also Avast free having disabled the realtime engine and enabled only the webmail P2P etc Was that goodsecure aproach It seemed that I did not have interferance problems Now I use only Avira 

    The last version I believe it was 9 of AVG free came with the link scanner enable which really cripples web browsing I couldnt find a way to disable it how to disable it it V8 was readily found in the programs control panel When I remove AVG free web browsing returned to normal Having Aria on my portable I knew I didnt like the user interface so I tried Avast in mt desktop computer from a casual review I have to say I like Avast free better than AVG free 

    eric Uhm Not to be rude but if you want your internet to be safe from viruses then use Avast instead of using some gay plugin that will most likely lag your internet more use Avast it comes with internet security And it does not even slow down and mogg my computer because avast is already open in the tray 

    However that being said please dont get me wrong There is no doubt Avira is a topnotch program As I said previously Avira did a great job on a virus I had on my computer when AVG did nothing at all to combat it So frankly there may come a day when I revert back to Avira I read where Consumer Reports rated it higher than many paid AV software out there So its credentials certainly can be considered impeccable 

    1 With Avira you can choose either to update automatically or just be notified when new updates are available In either case you can choose to update Now or Later They also let you know if you havent updated in two days which I think is very helpful 

    Well Janet you certainly raise good points But its not so much complaining as it is pointing out facts Even though avast would like you to buy their products youll have to admit they arent telling you on a daily basis that you would be better served purchasing their products rather than running their free version on your computer And avast is versatile and configurable enough that you can set it up so that they will ask you if you would like to update as opposed to just aurtomatically updating I mean why does it have to be everyday that Avira does this Couldnt they just nag you once a month or something in that time frame Surely we dont have to be reminded dayafterday that they have a paid version available do we Is our collective attention spans that short 

    Either way in all seriousness I must say you have a heckuva great product on your computer in Avira But avast is good as well To each hisher own I guess And btw dont forget Avira has a paid version available also But Im sure theyll tell you about that shortly themselves 

    Im always dumbfounded when people complain about Avira updates I have the free version and it updates quietly in the background whenever I boot up and then lets me know in an unobtrusive window bottom right of screen saying that my system has been successfully updated and that it has installed x number of filesYes it first flashes the nag screen which I automatically click on and then it updates with no problems everI consider the nag screen an alert to the fact that Avira wants to update and will be busy doing just that if I click to continue as opposed to closing the window By the way I seem to recall that the nag screen is the Notifier and that if you disable it  you will also be disabling the automatic updates And Avira will often update more than once a day They always notify me when I need to update asking me if I want to do it now or later so there is never any issue of my not being able to reach them 

    I have in an earlier post addressed the issue of the myth of not being protected from bad emails with Avira I am always alerted to dangerous emails and you get several options of how you want to deal with them I always check Deny access Yes this is in the FREE version This issue is dealt with at length in the Avira Antivir Free forum It also alerts me to dangerous websites 

    aviras major problem is very slow updatessometimes it took hours so i stopped updating then windows will say av is out of datethey say their servers are busy and could cater only paid usersthis is a pressure tactic to sell pro version its false forced me out of ssuite office otherwise a featurerich office suite and horror of horrorit wiped out downloaded movies after a scan after an year i returned to my tested avast which nicely updates on net connection and lastly the av comparative study was criticized on ethical groundsfor accepting funds from participants and avira was a major sponsor 

    Actually I have used all three My first AV was AVG I had it for a while and it seemed as if it was working pretty decently for a really long stretch No complaints really It was unobtrusive and the PC was just hummin along so to speak Up until a rather wicked heinous insidious malware named Antivirus Live took over my machine Well  my system was now infected And now it was time to see what tools what line of defenses just exactly what capabilities AVG had in its arsenal to combat this evil presence this foreign body if you will that which was now making its home  on my computer To be honest this event took place a fairly long time ago so exact specifics are somewhat hazy However I still remember the futile feeling I had as I had lost control of my PC Web pages were opening without any actions taken by me Homepages were changing All I actually could do was watch as AVG was being well AVG average In other words perhaps AVG is a firstrate AntiVirus but it was NOT with THIS virus Antivirus Live And NOT on MY computer at THIS pointandtime So  what is my next step What do I do now Wellenter Avira 

    I had heard a lot of good things about Avira Not the least of which was a VERY favorable review given by that leading consumer magazine I wont divulge its name here as they may file a lawsuit against me for using them as a reference and making their name public Hey ya never know Ashraf might dime me out  But Ill give you a hint The first name is Consumer and the second name starts with an R Do we have any Wheel of Fortune afficinados in the house Okay good now they cant get me HaHa 

    At any rate I turned to Avira because of word of mouth and the CR mag review Aw who am I kidding I was frigging desperate So I downloaded and installed Avira I turned to religion clutched the rosary beads and cut loose this highly acclaimed AV prog on this dreadful intruder which by this time was quite comfortably nestled in BOB  Buckets O Bolts aka my PC Long story short Wow Avira to the rescue It found Antivirus Live really fast It sprayed its pixie dust OK I embellished this part of the story No pixie dust was used or harmed during the eradication of the virus and wiped Antivirus Live right out My PC was no longer in ITS hands anymore I was now my computers ruler king and sovereign leader I know I know I need to cut back on the caffeine Alright so Avira was good I was darn good But do we always need to be reminded how good it is and how even better it would be if we were to only dip into our collective and respective wallets or purses and fork over the greenbacks to them once a year In other words to say Avira has nag screens would be as accurate as saying what a lousy economy we currently find ourselves in Avira constantly was flashing their nag screens and trying to get me to upgrade to their paid version And yknow what Thats fine Its their company they can choose to run it as they see fit But conversely I too have a choice I can choose to look elsewhere and seek out a AV program that will fit my needs And I did Enter avast 

    So  I have used avast for a good long stretch now and I am currently using it today I have to register it once a year But in the interim unlike Avira I dont even know its there Except of course when it automatically updates its antivirus definitions and tells me so by way of both a visual cue a dialog box and  or an audio cue a female voice announces database has been updated Oh and it also has blocked a number of malware from penetrating and doing harm to my machine As this too is also announced visually and audibly by avast So I say allinall Avast is well a vast improvement over what I had 

    Hey look I understand Avira may be somewhat better than avast at malware detection But I dont think it actually is that much better And I happen to think that avast overall is more comprehensive with more features that have swayed me over to their side 

    Now having said that I do realize things in the computer world can change very quickly So I will try to stay on top of things and rely on knowledgeable people such as Ashraf to tell me otherwise Or to give me a headsup about how another product or products have now surpassed what Im using at the moment But until that time comesIm hanging my hat with avast 

    Oh one last thing I think a lot of people are taking avast more seriously as well because when I last checked over at downloadcom avast had leapfrogged Avira and is closing in on AVG as the most downloaded app 

    Diana You make a lot of sense in your comments as I have also tried BIT DEFENDER I also had AVIRA at one point until they had the difficulty with supplying the FREE users with timely updates or none at all I switched back to AVAST and have NOT looked back since TheRube  

    Hi all I loved the article very thorough and informative Thank you I have used AVG in the past My machines ended up with viruses I went to a paid for anti virus for 2 years Bit Defender I thought it was good the first year but the second year was shear hell I then went to Avast which I am still using today with out any problems Im always looking for something better You know the grass is always greener on the other side lol I had checked into Avira and almost changed until I notice all the false positives I dont have time for false positives I think the only reason they are rating a wee bit higher on the testing results is do to this false positive problem Take that away and Avira would fall short of Avast which I feel they do anyway For now and probably a long time I will stick with Avast 

    MY Computer Security Defense currently consist of the Free Version of AVAST AntVirus 50 Mad Good OUTPOST Fire Wall The BEST and the paid version of MALWAREBYTES AntiMalware Better Than Any Other in its league I also have the paid version of ZEMANA AntiLogger I can sleep comfortably at night Knowing Full Well that my computer is highly protected Thanks All TheRube  

    Ive been using Avast for about 2 years now I switched to Avira when AVG had an upgrade and it slowed my machine to a crawl I liked Avira until I noticed it didnt scan my incoming email I promptly looked for another good free antivirus program and came across Avast It did everything I wanted and it didnt slow down my PC like AVG did Im very happy with Avast 

    In my experience the memory usage stats for AVG are way out Raymonds graph doesnt seem to take into account that AVG stores a copy of its database under the SYSTEM process On all PCs I have seen with AVG on the system process always consumes around 80100MB it should be 1MB and never drops Anyone else notice this 

    Me Im still continuing on with Avast not a single false positive in 8 months superb email detection and flagging easy on resources and not a single update problem  unlike the horrendous experience of Avira where insult was added to injury by its appalling splash screens 

    I have used all of these three antivirus programs first I had Avira but its popups just discouraged me to go on relying on it Then I switched to AVG but I ran across problems removing a trojan then I moved to Avast and I keep it to this day version 48 I didnt bother to update it to version 5 because I am contented with what its old version provides 7 shields scheduled boottime virus removal good set of skins It is the less obtrusive of these three products it does not slow down my system its scanner is not among the fastest ones but there is no perfect antivirus application Avast plus Outpost optional spyware cleaner SpyBot  Search  Destroy is the perfect security combination for me 

    I cannot say which is the best antivirus but I am certain which one is the worst and this by far is Norton the most horrible application I have ever had on my machine I bought my laptop with it installed on it 

    Ive been using AVG free for a while and it has worked for me But a note of caution though The other day AVG did an auto update and it updated to the newest version requiring a system reboot However after restarting I began getting BIOS problems an errant BIOS code on the LCD readout beeping indicating that the CPU fan supposedly not working but it was Rebooting did not solve the problem I was scratching my head as to what to do Then I decided to go into the BIOS Seeing nothing amiss I did a reload of the BIOS my ABIT IP35 Pro mobo easily allows this via the F7 key After doing this and rebooting no more problems 

    Many thanks Ashraf for your review and to everyone for your comments Ive found AVG draggy  slowed things down on my desktop computer For my PC tablet Im mulling over avast vs antivir However Im going to try antivir and if those orrible pop up ads appear I will go to that link you advised  thank you Potanin And thanks again for this website 

    radek Back in the day Nod32 used to be very good Now not so much IMHO It rarely does as well as even the free AVs in the tests and it is noticeably heavy in my system Kaspersky heavy but better protection Norton light and much better protection or Trend very very heavy but good protection are good alternatives 

    asraf no offense buddy i love ur site but ur data is in conclusive my reason is that this was between avast 50 and the other anti viruses right however the detection scan came ended up using Avast 48 which is not proper data but i love the review and im not sure how many people check this out but this helped me decid on avast 

    i have used Avira now for years and find it the best havent had an infection since it has been on my systemhowever when i tried to uninstall it to try out their security suite it removed a dll file that windows neededno big deal but a little scary at the time does not slow computer like avg well worth the download 

    Avast five Home Its great I even tested it with live viruses in a VM and it removedstopped execution of all that I tested Has a basic firewall too I recommend it to everyone and recommend they dont have another piece of software for firewall as Avast has it covered 

    Im coupling Avast 5 with Comodo 4 which has Sandboxing features and Defense which I find very useful With all these features activated I do not notice an increase in RAM usage In fact a mere 12 increase is detected 

    I am a user of Avast 50 Please note the full scans for Avast can be shortened with the activation of the Persistent Cache feature under Settings in the Full Scan dropdown tab The first time scan for Avast5 on my p8400 core2 duo PC with 4gb ram and Windows 7 64bit took 40 minutes which is a long time However conduct a few more full scans with Persistent Cache turned on and it dropped to a mere 15 minutes by the 3rd full scan In fact this tip has been highlighted in the Avast Blog here  

    In terms of efficacy basically among major products  including the freebies here  theres little difference in the rate of false negatives certainly not enough to guide a usage decision Its the rate of false positives that is far more important since when this rate gets too high the temptation is to dismiss the warning And THATS when you get infected 

    I dont see the rate of false positives here but it is much higher among the freebies than the paid programs While Avast used to be quite high on this Avast 5 from my experience has calmed down quite a bit Avira is still annoyingly high 

    1 I use Avira because it has the best detection 2 It very rarely gives me false positives 3 You are protected from bad emails even if you have just the free version without the additional email screener see Avira forums The email screener simply gives you and an additional layer of protection by getting it sooner I get an alert as soon as I click on a contaminated letter in my Inbox at which time Avira immediately gets rid of it for me Have not had any infections during the years I have used free Avira although it has warned me of many infected letters 4 It always updates regularly and quietly popup box in lower rhand corner of screen tells me it is updating I have never had any problem updating 

    I have recommended and installed avast free on customers computers for about 5 years Considering the frequency of email infections an antivirus program that does not scan email before opening them is useless The programs that perform within a few percentage points of each other may be essentially equal While some may miss an infection by a definition file they may stop the infection when it launches by a behavior scan 

    False positives Some antivirus programs have higher detection rates but also falsely detect too When they break legitimate programs because they delete or quarantine valid files they can be as annoying and disruptive as a real infection For users not willing to spend 40 annually for security I recommend avast free plus Malwarebytes paid version 

    I downloaded AVAST when you first posted that you were going to try it But now I find it causes my PC to be very slow The size of it is 163MB So I just deleted it from my PC Hopefully it will start to act faster Thank you for all the info on your site I always read your reviews but often find that I really dont need to download some of the giveaways that sound so great Again thank you I so enjoy all the good and the bad Mary 

    I have been trying out the 2 anti virus and decided on avira I have been using Ghost for backup and avast actually decides that the backfiles are trojan files  and I am under the impression that Aviria has a high incident of false positive 

    I have used all of them and i stick with avira AVG missed a piece of malware that almost made me kill myself and i couldnt stand how slow avasts scans were avira scans in around 45 minutes and finds everything thats ever given me a problem its the first thing i install on clients computers 

    Ive been using AVG free since it was version 80 The one thing I dislike about the newest version 90801 is you cannot shut it down by right clicking the icon in the taskbar If one wants to shut it down one must do so by opening task manager and closing avgtrayexe in processes tab This was changed 2 program updates ago Ive gotten my share of false positives and was having a difficult time with popcap loader module an active X used on some websites to play Popcap online games AVG kept deeming it a PUP and although I instructed AVG to ignore it would not ignore it This new version of AVG doesnt seem to care about popcap loader module For a while on an older version AVG declared Zipinst from Nirsoft a problem and would not let me access it Zipinst has been on my computer since I bought it in 2006 The newest version seems to have the bugs worked out and AVG free has stopped more than one bad program in its tracks Since memory is not an issue Ill stick with AVG for now as Im familiar with it and most important I trust it Paul AKA magiccrpet 

    I have been using all three of the above AVV but at different times so a fair comparison is difficult I like Avira best but lately there was a report that while Avira outperforms most other AVV in terms of detection its ability to remove the detected malware is somewhat less than say Kaspersky 

    The latest version of Avira is much improved and I seem to get computers in on a daily basis that have AVG installed and are very badly infected with malware I used Avast previously before I found Avira was more effective at removal and detection I will test it out again but I find Avira is light loading and quick 

    The one or the other would have been bad enough but it was clearly time to uninstall Avira when the point was reached where I was being bombarded with the nag screen but denied connection to Aviras seemingly solitary update server 

    Teaming Avast with Online Armor has proved to be one of the best if inadvertent decisions Ive made compared to Comodos clunky obstructiveness and wellnigh impenetrable control setup OA has mirrored Avasts reaction speed and deftness of touch 

    Im a longtime avast user and have nothing but good things to say about it Its free has kept every installed computer well protected a few dozen computers over the span of my household and my friends and clients computers and is generally nonintrusive after turning off those annoying audio alerts that is I recommend it to everyone I meet and its only gotten better over the years 

    One thing not mentioned in the article is AVGs link scanneractive surf shield That feature is the reason I install AVG on all my customers computers All 3 programs have a great resident shield but AVG is the only one Ive seen put an addon in the web browser IE and Firefox for safer internet browsing  

    Hi friend  Sorry for my late reply  I hadnt visited this web page in a while My fault  1 No The Smiley keyboard instructions do not work on all websites 2The link I am giving you answers not only point number 1 but will give you keyboard typing instructions for all smilies other than the 91 which Yahoo uses  

Its happening again Now that is the third version of his name only this time its not by Spoutnik himself It was expected but not exactly this way Deletion of a vowel was what Spoutnik would have liked    Ramesh Kumar Dont know much about my eyes being sharp Its just that I was browsing through these posts and read Adrians comment no 141 which I thought was very easy  simple way to say things in a humorous way And I got interested in knowing how Spoutnik was going to reply As I revisited this page 34 times before Spoutnik actually replied that was easy to spot I wonder if he is going to delete u or i next time he posts 

    I always tell all my friends and family to do research on what ever program they want to install and to look at your site first for freebetter programs than work better first Keep up the good work that you do 

    Hi Locutus  Ive just made a commitment to our friend Bill3 I quote  Locutus our administrator in  taught me that if you type  followed by  you get   if you type  followed by D you get D You can meet Locutus on our main blog or inside the forum Locutus btw is sensible humorous  helpful in equal measure 

    1Thanks I always practice a pruned down startup in Glarys I also double check if it remains disabled in all other system optimizer apps too On rare occasions I found that disablement was not automatic across apps But then if software was a person it would be an eccentric genius  genius most of the time eccentric aka temperamental occasionally  isnt it 

    2Wow Yes using mostly portable apps in this given context is very smart since it wont affect registry Like you I too create folders elsewhere on the hard disk rather than using user log within C My Programs I choose to use My Programs  My documents minimally because both are on C Drive aka system drive If C drive crashes that would make me vulnerable to it Therefore I park the goodies box installers not exe elsewhere ie on another Drive 

    5You are 100 right Mercifully heuristics is there  most security apps use it Had we only had signature method to fall back on our comps would have died several times by now simply because coders often find it difficult to write signature code fast enough to catch newer pests The Conficker worm is a recent example It defeated most security apps Slimy guy  Fortunately that problem is now solved  

    Now for this Smiley thing you asked me I learned there are 2 ways of getting Smilies  the safe way  the unsafe way The unsafe way is Smilie websites Some of those websites often run a promotion  for every smilie you download they give you one virus free with it Just joking D

    1 Sandboxie runs your applications in an isolated abstraction area called a sandbox which is a secure area so any nasties are contained away from your main system files Under the supervision of Sandboxie an application operates normally and at full speed but cant effect permanent changes to your computer Instead the changes are effected only in the sandbox 

    Thanks very much for the compliment much appreciated moral boost The other trick I use is being very conservative You sound as though your pretty well up to speed and competent but the following may refine things a little  

    In computer science a heuristic is a technique designed to solve a problem that ignores whether the solution can be proven to be correct but which usually produces a good solution or solves a simpler problem that contains or intersects with the solution of the more complex problem Most realtime and even some ondemand antivirus scanners use heuristic signatures to look for specific attributes and characteristics for detecting viruses and other forms of malware 

    No I dont get regularly infected but I was taught and found that there are so many nasties that no one tool can cover them all so by using the specialist set in 1 to 14 you get the tricky ones and this policy has paid off many times However I only do my  BIG  scan once every 6 months and rarely scan in between 

    Thanks for the tip about Sandboxie I only just learnt of it in this review so its on my  Google to do  list I would be most grateful if you have any specifically good links hot tips etc for me to teach myself 

    If not then I think you should its free and will save you getting infected in the first place Its highly regarded free tool and many would place it above any antimalware protection in thatr it prevents you getting infected rather than protecting after you get infected and as they say prevention is better than cure 

    Examples 1  2  Absolutely right Win Patrol  Anvir Task Manager point out if some bad boy process is doing its thing Example 3  yes I quarantine that sys file in Avast 48 before passing verdict as to whether that process is good or bad The finding out part I do using Glarys Utilities Pro on Google  within Glarys own database Example 4  jvPowerTools 2009  WinUtilities Pro 941 helps me catch if a bad boy app is doing fishy things to the registry Example 5  I know if I have a phoner  if he is a bad boy app  Anvir Task Manager  Whats My Computer Doing tell me that 

    Thanks for the Process Explorer tip I have used it Ill endeavour to use it even more savvily to prevent software clash Hey Wait a minute your excellent post contained a clue so I could figure it out Upon checking the gui of Process Explorer 1133 I discovered there is no option to delay a start up The only option is to suspend or kill a process Got it Bill3 You simply suspend a process You are a great suspender just joking  Bingo 

    Thats a neat trick Using this approach one can well have more than one AV on ones machine QED I intuit you are also using one other data execution prevention technique  that technique relates to the OS so it should be somewhere in Control Panel Ill try to figure that out 

    But Bill3 there is one thing you said I just dont agree with you on that point Im only an amateur with little experience who just gets by often with a lot of luck and System Restore No Bill3 you are humble but not an amateur You get by not because of your luck but because of your talent Had it been the real world Id say Bill3 its been a pleasure meeting you I am still saying it any way Ramesh D 

    Ive been using avast for a while now and like it quite a bit Ive never liked AVG much though I havent tried it for a couple of years I have never tried Avira but Im setting up another W7 box here soon so I think Ill try Avira out on it Id be curious to see the differences 

    I always run my fullscans as Im heading to bed so I dont really mind the time it takes And the delta on its memory usage is so much lower it really makes it worth it to me I can be running 10 development apps at a time so my memory is precious to me 

    Example 3  With virus alerts just quarantine them then google to find out what they are then restore them as they may just be heuristic or remove them if they are actually defined as a virus by Mcafee or another competent security expert This is one I dealt with last week  

    Example 4 Other complicated questions about the registry or happenings are often easily answered by referring to the origination program Open Office or JV16 would be OK but the rest is really down to experience which is where the novice falls down 

    3 I thought that it would not be because these apps reside on the RAM due to which just removing them from startup is not sufficient  after all they would still run parallelly in realtime wouldnt they  clash because of that Or are there additional configuring tweaks as well apart from disabling from running at startup 

Experience  insights please See examples in 1 Im sorry I cannot advise you further Ramesh because Im only an amateur with little experience who just gets by often with a lot of luck and System Restore    Would be grateful if you could share the following so we could learn from you 1I quote you  Comodo Internet Security that has real time and registry monitoring so you have to be savvy enough to answer awkward questions Could you share some tips please 

    2I quote you  You need to disable some of 1 to 14 from running on start up with your start up manager Is the mere act of removing some of them from running at startup adequate to prevent software clash I thought that it would not be because these apps reside on the RAM due to which just removing them from startup is not sufficient  after all they would still run parallelly in realtime wouldnt they  clash because of that Or are there additional configuring tweaks as well apart from disabling from running at startup 

    3I quote you  Also you need to be very savvy in dealing with the results or you could easily wreck your system Assuming wishfully for a moment that there are not too many types of results could you share your experience  insights please 

    JustAnothernoobie  This is a useful  absolutely new insight about AV software you gave Therefore I am quoting you It only underscores the point that ironically common sense is often regretfully uncommon D 

    Yes indeed it is useful to at least see if a log file of an AV after scanning is empty or not Meaning even if the scan detected no threat even then the scan report still has to list out all the files it has scanned  

    There is no denying the fact that everyone who has an AV software has to at least cursorily glance at its scan report When one is busy one can quickly save that individual scan report in order to cursorily glance at it later Ramesh  

    My past experience with the free version of Alvira was rather strange I think a kid in the neighborhood was hacking me for fun for a LONG time but the Alvira would start acting dotty the fail to load and then when it DID load it would supposedly do a scan report nothing detected and yet the log file would indicate that actually no files were scanned at all Files scanned 0 weird I tried Avast and it would just keep crashing I now use the latest AVG 90It didnt do well either in the past but at least it now APPEARS to be doing what its supposed to do although the last 3 months it has detected only a couple of threats Im using Private Firewall 70 now and I tried to tweak out the ftp PP2P and all that networking stuff but who knows if I did it right lol When the hacking problem was at its worst the only paid program that held out longest  Nortons McAfee just died was the PCCillin one but it too gave out after a while the kid is really a little pain in the ss genius maybe Ill try Avast again along with the Panda Cloud AV Maybe he hasnt seen it yet to reverse engineer itlol 

    I have found that no one antivirus or antispyware is  THE BEST  but they all have different capabilities and merits so I scan with many of them and get the best of all After all it costs me little time as I do my chores while the scan is proceeding This policy has proved successful 

    Main running security  Comodo Internet Security that has real time and registry monitoring so you have to be savvy enough to answer awkward questions Comodo BOCleanwhich is a behavioral analyzer put simply This keeps my system fairly clean but every few months I do a big  scan and the extras are  

    Ramesh Kumar The key to remember is that its no different if the program is integrated in to the OS or not in that case really An update is an update Only big advantage would be that updates for it would be part of SPs 

    Samuel In some ways is the frequent security patch thing a downer aka if on the one hand it protects ie security patch does it on the other hand break an app as well  if the app is baked into the OS Ramesh  

    Ramesh what I am saying about Sandboxie if Microsoft were to control it was that unfortunately Microsoft havent a great reputation of being able to secure their products and sooner or later Sanndboxie might get cracked and Microsoft would then have to issue countless security patches just to keep up 

    On point 2 Locutus has put it better than I can I always thought that No Script was an unnecessary browser crippler We all know that violent crimes take place but does that mean we should all don bulletstab proof vests every time we step out our front door just in case we get attacked 

    I am amazed at the amount of praise No script gets by its users on the Mozilla site they seem to think No Script is the best think since sliced breadhmmm somebody needs to give them a good shaking its not needed and they obviously have never heard of Sandboxie before 

    Personally I use Vipre  not free I find its excellent  very quick doesnt slow down the system at all There had been a number of false positives but I emailed them the file and they quickly took care of the problem As far as free versions go  I find that Avast at the moment is the one to use but its not a permanent thing as Ive seen versions of AV software change so much over time that I change my recommendations based on responsiveness and effectiveness of the software So my recommendations will change as the software does 

    KL Hi Am in total agreement with you on most points  seek a clarification only on 2 1Bundling sandboxie with Microsoft OS would spoil sandboxie because Microsoft has a propensity to spoil an app which gets baked in I could not grasp why you say this 2Disabling NoScript I could not grasp why you say this Ramesh  

    Samuel Chief I am delighted when you agree with me  equally delighted even when you correct me Ive articulated earlier on this blogsite that I admire your honesty  intellect  that everyone can benefit from it because it is somewhat rare finding someone who is a good human even though he is brightespecially nowadays 

    Chief I distinctly remember your using 3 AVs together scanning real time in your post on this very thread I said what I did because as far as I know you are the only one with the savviness to do it  benefit from it 

    I fondly hope once again that after you are through with your 3 articles youd do one on that since you found my thoughtsuggestionrequest interesting Once again I repeat that it would help many Even youd be surprised at how many would thank you either in writing or in their hearts Incidentally it would also drive up user base of Avast Avira  AVG 

    To supplement it with commercial streetsmarts Avast Avira  AVG could consider getting in touch with Ashraf for hosting those exes If Ashraf found that makes mutual commercial sense to this blogsite  to them then  obviously only then would Ashraf choose to host it 

    I say this because I intuit that this post  this blogsite has impressed developers or employees of Avast AVG  Avira not only for its being a bright blogsite but also excellent positive vibes aka community spirit  honesty Again in terms of commercial street smarts all 3 Avast Avira  AVG would have sensed the enormous trust all visitors of this blogsite have placed in their trustworthy  lovable webmaster Believe me that kind of equity is rare to findWhen Ashraf says it is good we downloadPeriod 

    Ramesh I think Sandboxie has come of age now and really should be right up there as far as recognition goes with Antivirus Almost every novice user knows of or has heard of the term antivirusbut not that many as a percentage of current PC users around the wold let alone novices have heard of the term Sandbox 

    Another way to popularise it instantly would be for Google to buy out Sandboxie and repackage it as a Google application for the masses Although I hear Chrome already runs in a sandbox Im not sure how this compares to Sandboxie and also as I mentioned earlier Sandboxie isnt restricted to just protecting you whilst you surf but with other things like emailopening video files photos using MSN messengerthe list goes on 

    If anyone is still using browser crippling extensions like No Script then its time you got got rid of No Script and start using Sanboxie that way you get your browser back and surf without worrying about malicious scripts and still stay safe 

    As to integration being a fad for Microsoft its not Far from it in fact One of the main reasons Microsoft is disliked by the EU and the DOJ is that Microsoft has a history of integration which both think is illegal 

    I also notice one other thing from MicrosoftI do not yet know if it is just a fad or a trend In terms of features Microsoft in its OS seems to be doing backward integration aka baking into the OS added functionalities which earlier existed as standalone apps 

    At one time they added a browser into the OS Internet Explorer later they added an Email Client Outlook Express  in Win7 they added an app which calculates the no of days between two dates Earlier standalone 3rd party apps used to do this 

    If this strategy from Microsoft is not a fad but a trend perhaps in a subsequent version of OS Microsoft might offer a sandbox as well Microsoft Security Essential is presently a standalone app which exists on an apartfromtheOS basis I wouldnt be surprised if like other functionalities an AV also gets baked into their OS one day Since 2 AVs cannot coexist due to software clash that one single action would not only improve Microsoft OS market share further but also incidentally  regretfully be a body blow to 3rd party AVs Perhaps antitrust laws may not permit this eg Europe today protests an email client from being bundled in Windows OS licensed in Europe 

    Be that as it may I hope all AVs now offer sandbox too by way of being proactive Not only would it help the AVs compete more effectively with each other but also with Microsoft future versions of OS as well The consumer too would benefit 

    Whilst I still use Avira and Win Patrol with OnlineAmor and there seems to be some good advice by the comments I have read Surely the best Free protection against viruses and spyware is actually niether Avira Avast or AVG but Sandboxie 

    Dont forget you dont have to restrict Sanndboxie to just browser threats you can open email and their attachments inside Snandboxie or you could open videophoto files in Sanboxie in fact virtually any programeven MSN messenger or Skpe in Sanndboxie safe in the knowledge that if a virus of spyware is picked up it wont get further than the within the walls of the sandbox and therefore keeping your computer completely safe 

    Dean  Id be very grateful to you if you could explain why you suggest that the next time around it would be worthwhile reviewing Microsoft Security EssentialForticlientRisingAVComodoAVPCToolsAV PreventonAVImmunet  PandaCloud Do they have some useful features which these 3 dont Grateful if youd share it please because a larger mkt share app though reflective of consumer preference need not necessarily be the best Therefore please share your thoughts 

    Sujay  Absolutely right If 2 AVs are feature equivalent but one has a sandbox as well then the one with a sandbox pips the other to the post precisely because having a sandbox accomplishes things which not having a sandbox cannot accomplish I do wish that from now onwards all AVs offer a sandbox too Splendid point you made Ramesh  

    I work on alot of computers and when it comes to older computers I normally put AVG for performance If its a newer computer with more RAM I normally put aVast I have for years now used aVast and recommend it Years ago I wasnt sure which one I preferred but over all aVast seems to work well with the other programs I use I have never used Avira but most of my clients dont know anything about computers in the first place and would probably freak if it has alot of false positives 

    s Protection against high risk files nor suspicious websites is done through sandbox No free antivirus in this list provides this In its previous version Rising free version provided sandbox feature I dont know whether it is in their present version 

    I have tried Avira and I felt it just didnt have that many options besides virus scanning avast 5 just has so many more things to offer especially when Im surfing the web So many times avast has blocked websites that tried to download crap on my computer websites that mcafee siteadvisor didnt catch I think avast especially with their new interface is one of the best antivirus programs out there 

    Cad you like most other people are only thinking about the most extreme cases First of all Avira is not going to suddenly pop up out of the blue and say that you have a virus So get the idea of false positives out of your mind If you do a scan of your computer Avira may flag some files as being infected Hell my Spysweeper does that to and I am paying yearly for that The good thing is that such files are put in quaratine They arent erased So when yu come home you can check and see if such files are good or bad and restore them if necessary It is so much better to be safe than sorry Second no matter how well a security product claims how great it is at detection the NUMBER 1 antivirus product is you the user Dont go to porn sites or warez Be careful about downloading movies or pics or music from file sharing sites Dont open attachments in emails Dont click on links in email messages As far as malicious websites firefox and IE already have website blacklists It is far better to have a product tht catches 99 of bad things along with some good things than to have a product that atches 80 of bad things but at the same time letting some bad things get through Avira is a good product but its detection rates are a little bit lacking Dont get avira because they made the interface pretty to look at You should be more cocerned about its detection rates 

    Cad Delworth CEng MBCS CITP And see this regarding protection against malacious websites Free Avast doesnt do that It protects you against hijacked websites but not high risk ones nor suspicious websites including suspicious applications 

    Regarding scanning for malicious files  its a non issue because you dont really require this from either avira or avast especially when you have WOT and such other free and best tools available Even if you are using Avast I suggest you install WOT if not installed already Its really good 

    SujoySujay Thank you for this updated info I will check the link and surely try it in future Now this will make me keenly await the upcoming test reports of Virus Bulletin and Av comparatives Only prob is that Virus Bulletin detailed report is made available very late to free members 

I upgraded to v50 of avast with no problems whatsoever and I wonder whether the people on the avast forum who had the problems are using Vista or Win7 I use XP and see no reason to downgrade to Win7    I havent used or tried Avira but personally Id rather have lower FPs because this home PC is shared with lesstechie people and though they are wellenough trained to basically shut it down if avast ever throws up any messages its still a pain and a waste of my time to deal with FPs later 

    I also note that the free version of Avira DOES NOT scan malicious websites nor malware downloads while surfing their terms not mine whereas the free versions of avast DOES scan and protect against both of these 

    Hi S what u have said was right Thats why I shifted from Avast to Avira But right now Avast 5 is out It came with lots of changes mainly in the field of customization I would suugest you to go through this screenshots  From here u can get some idea about new Avast In its previous release enhanced user interface was reserved for paid customers But now there is no enhanced one There is only one interface with all the customizations yet not confusing 

    Guys the antivirus to use is Avira Hands down Avast is 2nd but I would not recommend it When you install Avira choose high for the heuristics Yes high In all honesty I dont really notice a difference between the recommend setting and high Now yes Avira might give false positives but a simple look at what it flagged as suspicious will tell you whether or not it is so Let me ask you this would lyou want an antivirus that captures almost 99 of viruses and bad things along with some good things or would you want an antivirus that sometimes allows viruses to get through yet wont flag some good things Files that are flagged are put in quarantine so you can easily go back and restore them if necessary Lastly to along with Avira get Winpatrol This program will alert you to any new program that wants to startup with your computer and any changes to bho 

    I suppose the idea of multiple antimalware programs all running fully at the same time is mindblowing in the sense that Its not usually done and thats with good reason Having more than 1 can really screwup a computer As to a separate article on it that is an interesting idea but at the moment I dont have the resources or time to do it That and I already have three articles in the works that I should finish first 

    But what is the point if you cant even tweak the real time and on demand scan levels I have not used Avast much but I think they do not let you use advance settings where you can customize the protection If you cant even do that what control then you really have That is the first thing that I dont like in Avast free version where advanced controls are hidden from you Whenever I install Avira the first thing I do is open config in expert mode  set its real time as well as on demand scanning to scan for all files tick some additional settings which were off by default in action for concerning files I set notification level to combined expert And I set heuristics of both real time  on demand scanning to high detection level And further down the menu I tick several other settings I like it that way Some one else would like to do it differently Avira lets you do that in free version What else do you call customization in an antivirus programme if it doesnt lets you fine tune the most important thing  that is your protection 

    Tim thats why I keep a copy of the versions installer as well Youd already have noticed that some software sites remove the old installer  keep the installer of only the latest version Cnet has started doing that If you are in a fix go to  

    The updated version in many apps is a real goof up nowadays I suspect it is not due to coding but some silly cost saving effort which failed Sad but true The guys should at least be honest  savvy with a changelog to match that updation Let us both as well wishers hope that this was just one silly mistake from Avast which they wont repeat 

    Ramesh Kumar Hi RameshI have used Avast for at least the last 7 years and have had no trouble at all I am using 48 on windows 7 64 bit and it just does the job it needs too I did update to Avast 50 a few weeks ago but had several issues with itAfter going on to the Avast forum it seems that the latest from Avast is almost as bad as the old Norton that clogged up your system 

    I am a system builder and I tend to install Avast as a matter of course I have several systems running Avast all with no issues Avast can be a problem to uninstall fully but you can get an uninstaller from Avast website 

    Dear Ashraf you have not mentioned few important features of these AV s 1 AVG can scan USB drives when inserted although this option is not activated by default 2 Both AVG  Avast can be configured to perform actions on detected threats in on access scan automatically This feature is available in paid version of Avira 3 AVG can scan for tracking cookies in realtimeonaccess 4 AVG can scan for malware related registries 5 AVG by default installs a toolbar in IE  FF This is not necessary for the action of link scanner 6 Scan optimization for Avira is not available in windows xp 7 Avira and AVG checks update only once a day But Avast by default checks at every 240min 8 Avira shows nagscreen during update AVG shows notification in the main window and AVAST free behaves as trialware until registration 8 For those who use their laptop in two places like in broadband connection and in a proxy server with authentication face problems with autoupdate of Avast and Avira For them these settings has to be specified But AVG has a option to try to connect through proxy  if fails then connect directly This solves the problem in autoupdate I have personally faced this problems 9 Avast has screensaver scanning gamemode 10 Avast  Avira can create and schedule special scan 11 User can add suspicious files in quarantine in Avast  Avira and send them Also they can report false positive AVG has nothing like that Thats all I can remember I have used all three But mainly Avast and Avira None slowed down my computer Scan speed of avast according to AV comparative is fastest but According to Reymond cc is slowest But from my personal experience Avast is slow in practical cases Avast is slow in scanning media files Otherwise scanning is really fast Although Avira is known for false positives I never had any problems In recent times Avast did a major signature based false positive which affected many computer adversely Also it did some heuristic based false positives malwaregen If u go through their forum u will know As i dont use AVG much I didnt know much about their false positives But they indeed missed some real malwares and as they have no valid forms to upload files things get worse I emailed a virus to them which were detected by all other scanners in virus total But even after 7 days the signature were not able to catch that Anyway in my opinion if you want a rock solid detection go for Avira If you need great customization features and good detction go for Avast And if you work in two places where for autoupdate u have to change settings go for AVG With this u have automatic scanning of USB Drives which is very useful 

    I havent upgraded from Avast 48 free to Avast 5 free simply because  the changelog was not clearly defined the user comments of those who used 48  moved to 5 was not very appreciative  in fact some user comments in fact suggested staying with 48 was better than moving up to 5 Avast had not rebutted the negative comments 

    1the remarks were not very appreciative 2some remarks were pointedly asking people to remain with 48  not move up to version 5 The Avast guys never rebutted those remarks  3cost reduction  cost control is on everyones radar  even for software developersI did not want to give up a ripe fruit for one whose ripeness I wasnt sure about  

    Since the recession started Ive observed this trick being practiced even by antispyware  even P2P clients User comments have even cautioned against updating to the latest version Therefore I was cautious Thats all 

    I never swear by nor swear at conventional wisdom BTW I am not a blind votary of lateral thinking Could you share this with us my dear friend  either by a post or dare I get wishful D by a seperate thread Everyone here is interested in computer protection Your article would be an excellent second innings in this wonderful cricket test match Youd definitely be the Man Of The Match D 

    I chose not to choose Avira after reading the cnet review  That review pointed out one thing Avira does not have but quickly went on to say that it gets covered by something else That phrasing did not go down well with me I think it referred to email attachments but I am not sure My pro Avast reasons are 

    1It tells you upfront that it offers protection from Internet Mail Instant Messaging Network Shield OutlookExchange P2P Shield Standard Shield  Web Shield This upfront thing leaves no room for guesswork This feature rich product is obviously having a smarter advertising agency copywriter as well  Oh I am not being facetious  I noticed that the other apps were either pointing out the different genres of infection they caught  virus trojan rootkit LSO etc etc or that they could provide you different types of scans  quick medium or thorough They missed the important point which Avast did not that in this case genreising should cover not only type of scan or type of infection but also type of occasion 

    2Avast also has this neat little round sphere which revolves when it is watching out or analyzing something When it is idle the ball remains idle Often times we go clickety click onetimetoomany  our comp freezes I stop clicketiness whenever this ball revolves No pun intended but the other apps just dont have the balls but Avast does D D 

    3Not too long ago Avast had a weakness which now it might not If a file got virus infected you could not cure the file in Avast you just have to delete it Period By the way AVG never had that weakness The ability to cure an infected file is a great plus point for AVG D I think Avast is not as good as AVG on that performance parameter Please correct me if I am wrong 

    4Unlike the others I dont know Avira Avast also offers you a bootscan I am not conceptually up to the mark on what is a bootscan but I have used it  happily It feels like you are in DOS mode in colour This scan tells you about all infections It also tells you about all system file spoilages  CAB DLL OCX which form part of your OS or apps which are corrupted etc I infer from this that savvy system users can then redownload just those system files reregister those system files  even rebuild their OS incrementally rather than having to rebuild the entire palace D 

    5BTW the bootscan takes as much time or longer than the nonbootscan  it explains the problem in an even more thorough manner  even during the scanning In the event of a major virus attack thankfully rare Avast itself tells you to use bootscan This is a lifesaver  just like having recourse to the worlds most skilled bypass surgery surgeon if one requires a coronary bypass 

    6Avast is the mkt leader in Europe  is growing sales  market share outside too I respect this fact because Europe has a very large number of developed countries Common sense tells me that because of development those computer users would be both savvy  demanding If it does well in Europe then Avast must be good 

    8Seriously there is one good thing  they provide daily server updates Ive noticed some antispywares not antivirus gently nudging us to accept P2P updates or Weekly updates The former is bad  the latter is unacceptably poor frequency BTW This trend started after the recession began 

    karen Yes same here No trouble with updates or false positives there were probs with slow update servers for free versions earlier but that has been sorted out Regarding FPs most home users shouldnt have any And no there cant be any difference between Fps in the free version and the full one because Fps dont occur because of reduced functionality of the free version as these are wrong detections by the antivirus 

    But its a big trouble if you worry more about FPs than the viruses or trojans and let the infections enter your system because your antivirus with low FPs misses many infections its detection rate being below to that of competitors in the business 

    I think you should be more worried about the malware if ur system has imp data in it and you use your system for any type of financial transactions Thats why it is more imp for me to defend my system from maximum no of viruses and trojans and so I cant settle for anything which has less detection rate than Avira At least independent and impartial testing tells you best about Aviras detection rates I will consider the results of future tests if these change But for now its only Avira and its completely trouble free for me 

    I wonder if there is a difference between the false positives that get reported in the free and pro versions Ive been running Avira Pro for about 9 months and I dont think Ive ever seen a false positive Of course Ive only had a couple of virusmalware alerts in that time too 

    Ashraf It is somewhat I suppose First I must admit that when I started using this combo Webroot was just AntiSpyware so I really only had AVG as my everything On top of that MSE is really the new version of Windows Defender which comes with Vista and 7 so MSE isnt an extra more like an upgrade As to why I keep Webroot and AVG now that Webroot is Antivirus too is that Ive learnt that they play off each others strengths for instance 

    AVGs Email protection integrates with Outlook so that no matter how you get your email or if its encrypted or not AVG can stills can it Webroot only scans POP3SMPT port traffic so no IMAP and no SSLTSL scanning On the flip side though Webroot has a much more powerful program scanner it will even load a program into protected memory scan it and only if it passes muster let it run AVG cant do that 

    Also helps that Webroot now has a Firewall along with a File Cleaner which removes unneeded files from your system sort of like Windows Disk Cleaner on steroids I got over 80 GB back on one drive and then I promptly refilled it D 

    I found the comparisons quite interesting I have been using AVG for the past few years with no problems and have not had to format and reinstall due to a virus or any other bug I have had very good luck with AVG and as of now I will continue using it I also have my daughter and her family using AVG with no problems 

    Thanks J  thats appreciated I did try Asrafs tip to remove the nag screen but couldnt get that to work  will try again sometime Avast seems to come out very well at the moment  will monitor the situation on another machine 

    All this and the recommendations are so timely After tripping over my old laptop for months I finally decided to take it to the office and just set it up there Lo and behold my AVG subscription had expired So I proceded to remove AVG and download the free Avast 

Downloading went quickly but the first complete scan took forever  1 34 hours Hopefully the caching will shorten that in the future Avast found one infected file in all that time in all those files    Keep in mind this laptop has not been in use for months and the last scan was via AVG paid Based on comments by all of you who are a lot more knowledgeable than me no AV is 100 So one missed file out of close to 90000 files isnt bad for AVG stats 

    And now I have a fancy that AVIRA will soon release a new version of its FREE flagship adding new features to it similar to those present in AVAST in order to avoid or at least to curb the migration of their users towards the new AVAST versionLOL 

    1on the AVAST FORUM and BLOG the developer said that the new AVAST version has bridged the gap with AVIRA as far as the lamware detection rate is concerned and the next AV COMPARATIVES report will publicly prove that although on its last August report it had already downgraded AVIRA beneath AVAST v48 because of the AVIRA high false positive detection rate problem still present now One more reason to move to AVAST do you agree with me 

    2 the AVIRA UPDATE SIGNATURES SERVICE gave me lots of problems in the past as I was often unable to update their signature database due to several problems occurred on their servers and this if you dont mind is a big CON for an Antivirus program isnt it I often complained about it on their SUPPORT FORUM but the only reply I got from them was to be patient or better still to move to AVIRA PREMIUM and spend MONEY of courseLOL On the other hand AVAST seems to work smoothly from this point of view So I think you should add this fact on your review because if you encounter problems to update the signatures database almost on a daily basis the AV program becomes pretty useless or ineffective Do you agree with me buddy 

    3 in addition to AVIRA AVAST and AVG I think it would be a good idea to write one day a review of the freeware PANDA CLOUD ANTIVIRUS talking about the PROS  CONS related to the new generation of AV programs based on the cloud technology that as you should know dont need any signatures update to work properly while surfing on the web are you aware of them 

    Please note that according to the reliable PC magazine PC WORLD PANDA CLOUD ANTIVIRUS is currently the FREE AV with the higher laware detection rate out there an impressive 994 so even higher than AVIRA itself and if PANDA CLOUD ANTIVIRUS has not been tested by AV COMPARATIVES till now its only because so far the methodologies employed by AVCOMPARATIVES never included the cloudscanning components of products such as PANDA CLOUD ANTIVIRUS that incorporate not only signaturebased cloudscanning but also cloudheuristics but its rumored that AVCOMPARATIVES will include this on their next reportso lets wait  seeLOL 

    As everybody knows or should know having a great AV software such as AVIRA or AVAST is not enough to protect your PC from malware when combined with a poor FIREWALL ANTISPYWARE ANTIKEYLOGGER ANTIROOTKIT HIPS program or whatever else extra layer protection available on the market 

    Thats why a review about this issue would be very much appreciated in order to establish which combination of security compatible programs is the BEST and Im quite confident to help you and your readers on this matteryou know Im not signing myself as KING OF FREEBIES for nothingLOL 

    Avira really have some problems with their update servers which for a realtime signaturebased scanner is of major importance Comparatively my Avast install hasnt missed any updates whenever one is available everytime I boot up my computer 

    Another thing to mention about avast is that the new version 5 has caching systems which really speeds up things like application launches and rescans therefore being really low when it comes to the IO department Rising AV had this feature too when I tried it but only limited to temporary cache and doesnt have the persistent cache that avast5 has 

The posted figure about avast taking long to scan a 13 GB drive was because there was no existing cache for avast yet Im sure the scan time will drastically change when the same files are rescanned    Ive been using AVG for almost one year and I thought its detection rates were higher a lot higherThis results show me the path I should take Avast I know Avast isnt the best in detecting viruses and malware but it isnt far away from Avira Ive always hated Avira for its offer window that pops from nowhere like a big bad virus that controls my computer AHHHH I just couldnt take it so I uninstalled it as fast as my hand could reach the mouse Did Avira do the same thing for everyone Moreover Im a feature lover Althought an antivirus shouldnt have those things it gives a great touch of originality which I doubt is available in other AVs I have an important question and Im sorry if someone already asked Does the features of avast interfer with PC Tools Firewall Plus Thanks for your answer 

    While I am obviously biased as I work for AVG let me just point out that relying on a single tester for detection is in my opinion not the best approach AVComparatives uses a quite obsolete collection of malware and the proactive detection is based on very old one year versions with a bit questionable approach To get better results I would suggest to at least have a look at some other good testing labs such as AVTestorg or Virus Bulletin As an example Virus Bulletin measures detection results for malware that really is prevalent and spreading not some old collection of scripts including batch files that only say Booh I am a virus Their Reactive and Proactive detection results are available free on their website Moreover the simple ondemand scan test does not reflect if a particular threat is blocked before it can actually infect your system  eg AVG LinkScanner block many threats that can only spread via web before they can reach your PC thus minimizing the need to create definitions for them Anyway my key point is that any single test is biased and for a fair comparison of product performance you should definitely use more sources AVComparatives is just one of them 

s Ive been doing it for a while actually and alls good While have multiple real times can cause problems it really depends on which ones and it seems I hit the nail on three that work togther fine    Samuel You mean AVG Webroot Security  MSE are running real time with real time antivirus enabled for all together on the same system And they have not run into conflicts so far But how do you know that some major conflict is not going to happen Dont u think that running 3 real time antivirus engines is a bigger threat in itself than some infection which could be found out  repaired through on demand scans if your single antivirus real time scanner misses of course you can run 23 real time antispywares behavoiur blockers whatever with one real time antivirus Maybe you have done it in some special way you will know better 

    s That would work but my idea was to have all the real time scaners on On my current machine I have AVG Webroot Internet Security Essentials MSE and ThreatFire protecting my system with all the real time protections on 

    Samuel You can install them together on the same system but you have to be careful to use only one as a real time protection and the other for only on demand scans This involves customizing at the time of installation and disabling all real time options of one of the antivirus I did that on one of my systems where avira was actively running and I configured Avast as to run on demand scans only Disabling real time of one is the only option if u want to avoid conflicts I suppose 

    I have never experienced an update problem with Avira free the first update after install will take 510 min then after everything is smooth and fast I wouldnt rely on Armor Online AV The firewall is probably the best there is but the AV isnt much Malwarebytes was probably the best free antimalware tool but nowadays I would advise SuperAntispyware for on demand scans As an AV occasional online scan recommandation I would advise FSecure after all they are the best commercial AV as today with G Data Security Personnaly I protect my PC with Avira free Online Armor pro or free Asquared pro and the occasional scans already mentioned and til now no problems XP sp3  Win 7 

    AVAST never installed properly onto my computer that last percent always gets frozen but after I exited it and run the application it seems to work well dunno why Anyways Avast is kick butt it has nice feactures like you said above D 

    I switched several months ago for the free Rising 2009 AV and found it quite secure and at the same time verly light event lighter than Avira 8  9 The 2010 version has just been released and it would be great if you could also benchmark it  its on  

    Just a hint for notebook users AVG by default scans the hard disk in the background and reports out of the blue the infections This may be nice for new users but not necessary for many others It drains the battery and uses more resources all the time I prefer the scan on access style Panda is the worst paid version because it also scans in the background but DOES NOT give the user the option to choose what to do with the infections Automatically deletes them for the sake of security Amazing drawback and I just couldnt believe after a lot of search that there was no option to change this 

    Online Armor is a VERY interesting and strong software which CAN be used together with the classic antivirus softz It may not be suggested in terms of resources and compatibility to have 2 antiviruses together but it was initially designed to be working along with others Designed so before antivirus was introduced to the premium version I use the premium successfully with Avast and Avira on a couple of computers So its a great addon for PCs you may want extra security  

    IOBit security 360 and all their products for many reasons except the fiasco with malwarebytes mostly because of suspicious control behavior were uninstalled from ALL computers Pity cause I liked the nice and background working defrag tool but what the heck there are safer options 

    I searched for another one and found AVG and used it for about a year I thought it was a good program but eventually found out it wasnt I ended up getting a virus It was an old one and very annoying nothing serious I had gotten itthrough downloading a highly recommended Free Web Design program Which eventually was found to contain that virus 

    I was informed that the virus I had was an old one that they hadnt bothered to put definitions for in their program because it was an old one and they didnt really care They informed me if I wanted better protection I should buy their Pro version I informed them that since they didnt care because I was using the free version why should I buy their pro version 

    im used to like avira because of their best detecting malware even though there are many false positive but recently when avast release their new avast 5 free antivirus i just got attracted with their new interface and all the extra features that were provided but now i think avira might be the best antivirus because we suppose to care about the best security for our computer not the features or the interface that matter 

    I have been using Avira for last one year Earlier I couldnt stick to any antivirus for long and would often change it Avira has the best detection rates as a result the other ondemand scanners including reputed online scans dont find any serious infections on my system apart from spy cookies 

    My main beef is that the updates slow my oldish computer Thinkpad T40 1GB XP SP2 to a crawl or slower Whenever my computer becomes snaillike and unresponsive I can usually count on seeing the little popup that says that Avira has just downloaded Godknowshowmany update files 

    If this happened once a week it would be a minor nuisance but it seems to happen a couple of times a day Since Ive had exactly ONE actual encounter with a live virus in decades of active computing the quite ugly NIMDA worm I dont think the threat is really worth the nuisance even without the nag screens 

    In my case I use the paid version of Malwarebytes and Eset NOD 32 on all my machines and those of a friends For anyone requesting a free solution I tend to recommend avast Free and Malwarebytes Free All that said the reports on Microsft Security Essentials are very favorable and may change the free approach in the future 

    Personally i use Avira I used to use AVG but the only thing it would ever detect are cookies Since then i got a new laptop and installed all of the protection programs you suggested ashraf and since then have had no problems and I enjoy giving installers permissions in half a dozen programs if it wants to change something 

    Im an Avira fan I tried Avast and AVG too but their main problem is that their on access scanning engine wont let me ignore a virus detection ie they force me to move to quarantine block or delete and in some cases I really need the option to ignore the warning and continue Of course I could add the folderfile to the exception lists but I find that too annoying As for detection rates Avira has a pretty good detection rate but it still missed some infected files 

    Ok heres some stats on Microsoft Security Essentials Scan Windows folder 12GB and 32but Program Files folder 600MB Time 30 minutes This is after a fresh restart where Firefox was just being opened and services just starting Memory usage User Interface 4MB Program Not scanning 45MB Scanning 60MB Also you can easily use your computer with no lag while it is scanning 

2 I grew weary of Comodos clunking inability to learn properly  in my particular experience it was the most amnesiac defender ever encountered Which is not to say thats anyone elses experience    3 I switched to Online Armor from the Australian developer Tall Emu In practice and in presentation it has proved consistently superior to Comodo Latterly Ive paid for the upgrade to the commercial version on one machine another is now running Online Armor PRo as a freebie thanks to the tipoff here on dottech 

    4 I teamed Online Armor with Avira but oh ye gods Aviras continual update problems became just too darn much to contend with Dont take my word for it Ask the many thousands of former users worldwide Aviras explanations were tardy inadequate and in some cases plain daft if your auto update fails and your attempt at a manual update fails then please download the entire signatures library as that will be up to date Oh Really 

    5 I tried AVG but briefly as much for a trip down memory lane as anything else I suppose I couldve done the same with ZoneAlarm AVG managed in its short life span this time around to flag three false positives and miss one actual The actual was picked up by the excellent Prevx 30 scanner which for some reason rarely if ever gets mentioned here 

    6 And so to Avast No I didnt particularly mind Aviras bloody terrible nag screens every time it autoupdated though yes I certainly did resent them when all I got was the nag but not the update But Avast has no nag screen So thats one up to Avast 

    9 Avasts scanning has  to me  never taken that much longer than Aviras used to do but in any event why does elapsed time mean anything I am perfectly able to keep on working on my computer during a scan And candidly if a scans ultra quick then Im actually not that comfortable Caveat neither slowness nor rapidity should ever be taken as absolute guides though I recently ran a Panda scan and it took three times longer to complete than Prevx 30 Panda found nothing Prevx did  nothing serious but enough to warrant investigation 

    10 I wouldnt use another iObit product if you paid me Trusting a companys software to do what it says its doing when it is wholly impossible to trust the company about what it says its doing makes not the slightest scrap of sense for any computer user And iObit 360 Security now in its ahem revised guise is no better and very likely a lot worse than SUPER antispyware or the venerable Malwarebytes 

    Thanks for the feedback My AVG expires soon so Ill replace it with one of the freebies Now just to decide which one to use Of course with Ashrafs fabulous review and all the comments from users I may just flip a coin 

    Harry Set Antivir to detect on read and write and you wont have problems with Email virus Actually Antivir doesnt advertise an Email protection because the free edition wont scan your mail during download Premium does but in factif you open infected mail it reacts instantly 

    The false positives in Avira were driving me nuts until I Googled it and found out how to dig in to the program and set exceptions Absolutely NO problem since Never ever had any any virus through email yet but I suppose that is a potential weakness What do you think about that 

    Samuel It actually happens very frequently its annoying but by no means a deal breaker It does that if its been running while on a carpet or if its 1GB graphics card is under heavy load Once I was playing a game Age of Empires 3 if you must know and I had to stand the laptop on its sidethe vent is maybe 12 under the laptop and use a fan to cool it off Luckily I have an external monitor I can use if needed 

    Samuel Which reminds me is this off topic but are you still planning on writing that program that records computer resource usage for designated software like we discussed so long ago It would be mighty helpful in future reviews especially ones on AVs 

    AshrafSamuel Actually forget it I will leave it as is I just realized the new data would be much more confusing than I want it to be The data would just reinforce what I have already presented above so I think we can do fine without it It would show the same thing the Launch Application chart shows except with more data  Avira has least impact avast second and AVG third 

    Betty Well aside from the extra features you get in the paid version they are both basically the same thing Honestly if you were to pay for a software I would not get AVG there are so many better choices out there for paid 

    Two things Microsoft Security Essentials is right now using under 15MB of RAM Im going to start a scan to see how long it takes to scan a 129GB hard drive picture files TIME TAKEN 44 seconds That seems a little lowbut its probably because theyre all picture files Now Im going to scan a 226GB partition 140GB used TIME TAKEN Ok its still scanning 7 minutes later Ill post when it finishes but rememberthis is 140 not 13 GB Is this a typo As expected there is one winner between Avira avast and AVG Shouldnt it be As expected there is no one winner between Avira avast and AVG 

    Use Avira or Avast in combination with Iobit 360 if you want to use free resourcebut i dont recomand to use in the same time with a commercial antivirus suitebecause add a new firewall or free or comercial firewallTo many firewall will stop network comunicationAlso remember that exist firewall in soWhat firewall will be your choise to everythink work well

    Hi Kerrie so sorry youre having these troubles At the time of this writing I only used NOD32 Antivirus not the entire Security Suite Its the antivirus component they specialize in and it runs flawlessly I believe on the Mac if you just get the regular ESET Cyber Security what Im using now youll have the equivalent ie no firewall Maybe ask them if you can downgrade since youre having so many troubles 

    Were you paid by Bitdefender to label them top for customer service Is this why they very rarely respond to a customers request get an F from the BBB and labelled with a caution notice Please feel free to reply and to justify your Bitdefender being top for customer service 

    I used to use BitDefender among others It lost me when I managed to get two different big viruses in a span of about 6 months years ago I moved on to PrevX which won me overkept catching things others didnt and took care of things that others couldnt Unfortunately it was acquired by Webroot one of the others I went away from so Im stuck with that if I want PrevX but its still running great with Comodo Firewall free Havent had a virus on my machine in the past 6 years because of it 

    For those that are Norton fans its not a bad scanner at all but as an IT pro for almost 2 decades I can say its a supermegaresource hog and doesnt do much better than others Ive found such as BitDefender Businesses love it because IT pros tend to stick with what they know Branch out a little and see the difference 

    Again thank you You still may have to hold my hand through out the process I hope not Well see Anyway I appreciate you I have another different subject question Why are the commentsquestions in this column so scrambled as to the dates sent in 

    I would go ahead and install Bitdefender now with Avira still installed When you are installing Bitdefender it should notice that Avira is already installed and ask you to uninstall it If not you will manually have to uninstall it In Windows look under Control Panel  Programs  Programs and Features  Select Avira and click Uninstall 

    Hey Jeff Well I did it I downloaded Bitdefender BD BD removed Avira but only after I told it to twice Same thing with the BD download I had to download BD twice to get the thing to get fully functioning Strange Also I had wanted to do the free version but for some reason that wouldnt download at all  it just froze So I downloaded the regular payable version on a free 30 day trial basis I know somewhere yall gave instructions as to how to do all that re the free BD but look as I might I simply could NOT find it anywhere So I did what I did Hope it works out okay 

    Only one big problem Microsoft Windows keeps making my screen flicker and then says that Desktop Window Manager stopped working and was closed A problem caused the application to stop working correctly Windows will notify you if a solution is available This happens about every 5 minutes or more frequently HOW do I get it to stop 

    Its too late now but I would have asked what need you had to change from what you were using BitDefender wont likely make your computer any faster especially after some time You also have to be careful in taking advice from security firms about this kind of thing mainly because many of them are sponsored by the same software theyre recommending to you Im NOT in any way saying thats whats happening here I doubt it from what Ive read but just be careful Good luck with BitDefender I moved away from it to use PrevX which is now owned by WebRoot 

    As far as your error if the point at which you started experiencing problems is when you made the move to a new program Eg BitDefender then you might consider doing a system restore which you can Google how to do for your operating system Win7 Win8 etc Your system likely build a restore point prior to installing the new program If so you can test and see if the behavior is still acting up 

    After reading most of the older comments the older ones were already online the newer ones didnt show up till after I logged on to comment  strange I wanted to comment on what Anonymous that begins Thanks for introducing some new antivirus companies to me said I still click on the Update requests What is the problem with that Yes Im naive I suppose Mostly just computer illiterate 

    Which leads me to my next comment problem Even after reading your free antieverything reviews I still dont know which ones to use Can I use more than one at the same time My computer is already very slow in coming on about a solid 3 to 4 minutes Nothing else is particularly fast but booting up is definitely the slowest I dont game and only sometimes use the social medias although that may pick up What IS Pinterest and how is it a social media 

    Theres a new Avira Antivirus ad killer utility available called BgPKiller It runs alongside Avira Antivirus and kills all Avira popups before the show up Without the ads popping up this is an even better antivirus solution BgPkiller supports Windows XP up to 81 If you try it dont hesitate to send feedback 

    I had a bad experience with Bitdefener I purchased a license installed it and then ran in to lots of problems I did not get any help and I had to reinstall the system This company only contacted me 2 years later to renew the license not cool at all 

    I have a 3user license of Bitdefender 2015 installed on 3 different computers all different makes Your comment about slow boot and shutdown times is very understated because it doesnt slow the processes it virtually brings them to a standstill its so slow 

    In order to verify that Bitdefender was the culprit I uninstalled it and voila performance rose like a leviathan from the depths Bitdefender may score high on protection but it is disastrous on computeronline performance 

    Thanks for the comment George The antivirus situation is always changing and we do our best to stay on top of the best products We are in the midst of an audit for this article right now Your feedback is very helpful to us and our readers 

    If you dont mind I have a few additional questions that could help our readers out Do you happen to know what version of AVG you had problems with Also what version of Avast are you running now that you are happy with And lastly what is the operating system of your PC 

    Not to discount Georges experience at all but my experience has been the exact opposite Ive been using AVG free for over 8 years now and have never gotten any viruses I like to try out new ones when I get new computers but always end up going back to AVG 

    Thanks for your comment When we last audited this article Avira scored 3 out of 5 stars on the AVTest Oct2013 for Windows XP We see now that they rate better for the new Windows 8 operating system We are in the process of completing another full audit of this article 

    Is it true that Mac computers are virtually virusfree How do they stand up against other forms of corruption such as spyware and phishing Im concerned about their compatibility or lack thereof with all of the Microsoft products I use at work etc Whats the real story with choosing a Mac instead of a PC 

    Great question we actually get this question a lot and Im glad you addressed it While Macs were initially considered much safer than PCs primarily because they had a more stable operating system and were less popular so therefore less targeted by hackers that is no longer the case today 

    The combination I generally recommend for Macs is a secure router if you are using Wifi use a good WPA password and disable remoteweb access to the router Internet security software I use ESET on my Mac and recommend their Cyber Security software and an identity theft product such as LifeLock 

    Furthermore if youre on a Macbook disable Wifi when traveling and not in use Lastly be vigilant  use different passwords for all your services 2factor authentication when possible you will need to verify you are you via a text message phone or email code in addition to your login password and consider a service such as LastPass to store them securely for you 

    Each computer is different I guess but versions 20 of NSS have excellent performance and contrary to old popular belief they do not drain system resources anymore Of course you still have to meet basic realistic system requirements but you know that 

    I just read an article about a vulnerability in computer webcams that allows hackers to take control of your webcam How creepy is that I happened to stumble upon that article as I was doing research on antivirus software since mine is due to expire pretty soon Thanks for the thorough list and reviews of the AV software available Its helping me wade through the sea of software so I can make a better decision on how to spend my money 

    I just read an article from last year on Times tech blog about how medical devices are also vulnerable to hacking attacks Talk about creepy Anyway I agree with the post above  thanks for all the information I think it will help a lot of people make a more informed decision 

    My cable IP Atlantic Broadband offers free to subscribers the NetSafe Security Suite I have had a paid subscription to Norton AntiVirus for several years My Norton subscription expires in one month and I am considering dropping it for NetSafe I havent been able to find any reviews or information other than that it is developed by Authentium Inc which I also cant find out much about Does anyone have any informtaion on NetSafe 

    I am sorry but at this time we have no information either on NetSafe  which could be good or bad If I were you I would ask Atlantic Broadband if you can sign up for this new service for free anytime and allow time for other people to try it out and provide reviews In the meantime renewing Norton for one more year would be a much less expensive risk then potentially getting a serious virus on your computer Better safe than sorry we say 

    I have never seen a review that included social media use as a primary reason for needing a particular antivirus program but that totally makes sense My teenagers and me guilty all spend a lot of time on YouTube Facebook and I really love Pinterest and since this is mostly what we use our family computer for I am thinking Zone Alarm is the way to go for us Thanks for your help 

    On your list of the best antivirus program that doesnt slow down your computer you have Kaspersy as 1 I have to disagree with you as its probably the SLOWEST of the bunch and really slows down the internet connection and makes networking a pain I have my own computer business so I deal with this every day and I use Avast Free which is probably the best free antivirus out there 

    Not only is Norton Internet Security a resource hog but I cant get it to uninstall completely It came preinstalled on my new laptop I declined the option to activate the 60 day free trial and proceeded to install the software and reboot my PC  

    Then I tried to install NOD32 antivirus which has a low footprint and has kept my PC secure for years I immediately got the message that Norton Internet Security was also installed and would interfere with the NOD32 installation 

    Norton Symantec is actually known to have this problem with their software For this reason they have released a removal tool that you should be able to execute wants to have all Norton software removed from your PC 

    Number one I really like their website I find it really calming and comforting I know that might seem silly but its like a doctors office I feel trust right away The site design is not trying to look like the flashiest most modern collection of images online Its like a safe place that looks like it has possibly been this way since the early 80s That is very mellow for me which I appreciate Its also something I find thats rare online  

     In many markets you find that all of the websites are competing to look just like one another I also like that Kapersky offers both Personal and Family computer security and business security When most people think of antivirus software they think of their computer Only now are people starting to realize that this has to come out of the home office and extend onto your smartphones and almost every other contraption you have that you use to check email or do online searches For their home security options they offer antispyware antispam standard antivirus data protection and encryption and Identity theft protection 

    Thanks for introducing some new antivirus companies to me This does expand my options some I remember a time when antivirus software was an option It was like I have a computer do I need it Lol The truth is that it was never really an option We just werent as educated about what types of things our systems were vulnerable to  

     I remember some of the types of things I used to click on my goodness And there was even a time when I clicked on those antivirus update pop ups We were so naive in those days it was ridiculous As far as antivirus software brands go I have had McAfee for a long time and I have always felt secure with it The only problem that Ive had with it is the same as other readers of your blog its plain annoying It used to slow my computer down so much when I booted up and then randomly when I was trying to get things done it would run a scan that you would try to pause and even pausing it or stopping it would take another 10 minutes 

    I like that this article broke out the best antivirus software offerings by the different kinds of users there are for these products I used to use my computer for online gaming quite a bit in the past and therefore I wanted an antivirus software that ran relatively lean and would not use up a lot of my computers resources in the process so those could be better used on the often complex and resourceconsuming game programs that I used so much  

     I do not use my computer so much for gaming anymore as I have a gaming console the Microsoft Xbox 360 that I use almost exclusively for any gaming that I want to do That device does not require any kind of antivirus software as the network that it operates on is completely controlled by Microsoft and will not allow for any invaders to infiltrate the system to take advantage of its users  

    I receive a subscription to Norton Antivirus software as well as some other security products thanks to my subscription to Comcast internet service They tout it as a three hundred and sixty dollar value per year for all the things that you get when you get their Constant Guard protection suite although I am sure that number is a bit exaggerated However I do know that Norton Antivirus would cost somewhere around a hundred bucks a year by itself if I were just picking it up off the shelf  

     I find this situation to be ideal as I would not have really a need for an antivirus software if I did not have a full time connection to the internet Not having a full time connection to the internet is not an alternative I care to envision for myself ever again so it all works out 

     The program as far as I can tell works quite well I have not had any problems with viruses since I have had it and it does not seem to suck up too many of my computers resources in the process What else can I ask 

    I have continued to do my Norton checks and they keep telling me that things are fine and I have no threats I however get notes like this RansomwareUkashVirusFBI Moneypak is a ransomeware alert claiming that your PC is blocked Once installed Ukash VirusFBI Moneypakwill displays a scary fake alert stating that your are visiting ilegalwebsitsUkashVirusFBIMoneypak completely locks your system so you will not be able to preform any tasks SetStretchexe Then I call Norton and get the song and dance about Do you trust Norton I spoke with some nitwit  Mozilla and she said there were ss of viruses and attempts to access my system I gave her the Police file  and phone also the IC3  They hung up after telling me they wouldnt call I am on my 4th computer Now tell me WHY I dont want the government to regulate the Internet 

    My First PC I have an HP Pavilion DV9000 running Vista Home Premium This machine came with Norton on it and ran like a charm for a year When Norton expired instead of paying to update I installed the free version from Comcast This version of NortonConstantGuard brings this machine nearly to a halt It takes well over two minutes to boot I cannot connect to internet wireless or wired and runs so slow that the machine is literally unusable Even Norton itself wont run when installed on this machine I cant even get the program to start up so I can run a scan Norton just sits and spins until I go into the Task Manager and shut it down  

    Im not a developer but can make my way around a machine I had to experiment  so I removed all the Norton programsfilesdirectories and registry entries I also removed all other software that might be considered competitive  and cleaned and defragged the disk PC ran like a charm  

    Pulled Norton off and directly loaded the free trial of Avast from CNet PC ran like a charm This is NOT a thumbs up for Avast I havent even messed with it but I updated the virus definitions and ran a scan so I know it is running  

    My Second PC I have a second HP Pavilion a DV6 running Windows 7 Home Premium Norton was also free for a year on this machine  and it ran like a charm When Norton expired  just for kicks  I loaded my free version of NortonConstantGuard from Comcast On this machine it is actually tolerable but there is definitely a dramatic performance hit on the boot and overall performance of the machine If this machine were just being used by the kids I would let it be but because I use it as a second machine for work and personal I have become annoyed at this version of Norton and am now looking for a replacement 

    I really didnt mind Norton when the HP factory install was running on these two machines Comcasts free version isnt worth the 360 value they claim Maybe I should bill Comcast for my testing time since their employees obviously dont use their own ConstantGuard products on their home machines 

     When selecting antivirus software you should keep several things in mind Ask yourself Do I need my computer repaired right away Do I need assistance with knowing which websites are safe Do I need protection from infected USB drives Which antivirus software best fits my budget 

     Many of the antivirus software programs advertise themselves stating that they are the best Nobody can advertise that they are the best for everyone otherwise they would be lying We all have different needs in antivirus software Only you can decide which program is best for your needs I use Kaspersky antivirus because it uses the least amount of RAM while giving me excellent coverage on the internet Kaspersky also gives me information on which USB drives are infected and which are not This information is extremely important to me because I once had a computer that was infected and I will never forget how important a safe USB drive is 

     I personally use the internet in my house for a lot of different things I stream video quite a bit over my computer and use it for gaming as well These activities typically use up a lot of my computers resources so I need a program that runs quietly in the background and does not interfere with my regular usage Another user may only browse static websites and check their email occasionally so they would be well suited to a program that runs a little more frequently and takes up some resources because they can afford it 

    My goodness this article is in depth and very useful I know people that play video games and as a parent I definitely have social networking concerns Though my little one is too young right now for it to be an issue those networks change and grow in capability every year so I know it is important as a parent to make sure that I have a good idea of how to protect my family  

     It would make sense that certain types of antivirus software programs would best clean your system from viruses that you download through video game portals or through music and media downloads Different criminals probably attack through different mediums  

     The whole thing really sucks that they can get information from us just because of our web use I am so skeptical about downloading anything these days because of these threats I really wish that there was a way to always know that you were browsing securely With so many phishing sites out there sometimes it can be scary I like how some antivirus programs do tell you if a site has a bad security rating though 

    There have been times when I installed an antivirus too late I knew I must have a virus and I tried to get rid of it But not all antivirus programs can deal with a virus that already exists and I am not savvy enough about computers to know how to deal with it myself Since I am looking to install a great antivirus and came here to read the reviews I think I will probably end up going with Bitdefender 

    Part of what I like about Bitdefender is the programs ability to deal with an existing virus and guide you through the steps you need to take care of it This was not even something I knew the software could do until I came here but I have heard great things about the Bitdefender program aside from the ability to deal with an existing virus I just happened to be firthering my research when I came across this article 

    I love these kinds of articles because you are obviously not trying to write about just one product to promote it Rather you are trying to give some real information so people like me can compare and get what they really need Thanks for sharing this information so I can make an educated decision 

    I have only had a handful of different antivirus software providers over the years but I have had the most experience with Norton and their suite of security products and I can tell you that my service has been very solid and I am very pleased with it  

     I have this service largely because it is provided by my internet service provider as a value added offering for being an internet subscriber with them I know just how expensive this software can be to obtain and maintain if you are buying it on the open market so I am thankful that I have found a way to kill two birds with one stone so to speak and maximize my internet investment  

     The best thing I can say about Norton antivirus above all else is that I hardly even know that it is there I can see the icon in the task bar on the bottom of my screen that tells me it is working but aside from that I never see it I like the thought of a silent protector working quietly in the background 

    My computer came to me with McAfee installed on it I seriously hate this antivirus It seems to slow everything down and yet it also seems to do my computer absolutely no good at all I do not even know why they market this Yes it is the free version but it is not like this version is prompting me to want to actually spend money on their product either 

    I have always gone with the free versions because I do not really do anything odd on my computer I go to the same sites all the time and they are all reputable sites so I never consider myself to be in a high risk group or anything like that But I have also gone through enough computers that when I bought my last one I made sure it was a quality machine It does more than I need it to but thats okay Now I just want to find a way to protect it so it lasts 

    I have also used AVG and I liked that program but I am looking to upgrade from it as well It looks like you have all the information I need right here so I can start comparing before I shop Thanks for that 

    Antivirus software is something I definitely need but havent spent any time looking into I was surprised that some of the top names Ive heard over the years werent in the top slot I guess it goes to show you that a name and a lot of advertisements arent everything 

    I was so glad I found this article Not only did it help me realize that there are some great antivirus companies I hadnt heard of before but I also learned that some of the bigger names have problems that I wasnt aware of such as Norton using a lot of RAM 

    I was really impressed with Bitdefender I loved the fact that it not only handles what is on your computer but whats on plugged in devices as well such as iPods and flash drives However I do have to admit that I was a bit stunned at how much it costs I know antivirus software is important but 60 a year or 100 for the best services seems outrageous Of course it is cheap compared to the cost of having to hire someone to fix my computer if a virus goes active in it And with all of the security issues online lately it might actually be money well spent even if it is more than I originally expected I bet they have sales throughout the year and I could check back here for those There are some promo codes in this section of comments 

    I have to admit I never heard of these antivirus brands before Of course Ive always heard of the big guys Norton and McAfee but did not realize that there were comparable products available It is interesting to realize that there are so many effective competing antivirus products out there  

     I think everyone has been affected by a computer virus at one point or another in their life I know this was especially true like in the 90s when people did not really realize that the Internet was dangerous  

     Everyone was downloading everything from free music to software programs that said they were removing malware only to be adding it again What a crazy time that was I think I had 2 computers crash within one month Now I dont download much of anything anymore that I dont pay a legitimate subscription fee for and Im even careful what websites I visit because some of them will open up popup windows that actually begin communicating with your PC just because you clicked open the web page  

     Before you start let me just say that these are not like most of the other review sites that you typically see on the internet Too many of them are little more than disguised sales pitches for a particular brand or company Here you will see that the authors really want to provide you with the information that you need to make an informed decision Each review includes both positive and negative information about each company 

     I think we are all recognize that nothing we will buy is perfect There will be both good and bad points The key is to have honest information up front and then we can decide what is best for our situation The antivirus software comparison table is also helpful this is a great place to start your research 

    I think that almost everyone who is a regular computer user recognizes the fact that they need to have a strong anti virus software program installed This just simply makes sense After all without something like this your computer can be exposed to all sorts of crazy and malicious programs bots software attacks and who knows what else The only possible exception to this would be if you have a computer that does not connect to the internet and you never intend to connect it 

     This article provides a lot of excellent information for anyone who is currently considering their anti virus software program options For starters there is a very helpful comparison table To me this is a great place to start It will give you a nice idea of what features and services are offered by each individual company 

     From there feel free to dig into some of the individual reviews These contain pricing information and even both good and bad points This helps to separate this as an honest review from the many that are used just to promote a certain product 

    I really do not want to spend a lot of time worrying about the maintenance of my computer or being slowed down by an antivrus running or worse get slowed down by an antivirus that is not running correctly I just want it to do its thing quietly in the background while I do my thing on the computer 

    I do not normally have issues because I limit the places I go and what I open in my emails or messages However my son is a bit more curious and likes to explore different sites and games I do not mind if he wants to play a game on the computer I just want to make sure that my computer is protected while he is doing it I cant even imagine how upsetting it would be to have my computer screwed up just because my son wanted to play some game But I cant tell him that he is not allowed on the computer either So here I am trying to decide which antivirus to buy It is kind of stressful actually I have other things to do so I think I will just take your advice and check out Bitdefender It looks like it is perfect for us 

    Antivirus is an area that I have always had problems working with I do not really know a lot of technical information about computers I just know how to use them to get done what I need to get done So for me choosing an anitvirus has always been a hard process to make it through And most of the people I know are no help at all because they all have their own opinions and they are all different Of course they all think they are right and will spend hours arguing about it In the end I usually end up going with whatever is installed on my computer The problem is that my son also uses my computer 

    He is pretty responsible about what he does on my computer but as he gets older his interests change and I have to allow for that I dont explore a lot on the Internet unless I am doing research so I dont worry near as much about how my actions could impact my computer But he does explore and just last night 3 alerts came up Its time for me to get serious about an antivirus program So thanks for the table even if I dont understand half of it I think I can at least get a better idea of what will work for me 

    I really cant say that I have ever had any luck with Norton I like AVG but I have been using the free version and lately I have been thinking that it is time to invest in a good antivirus program that I can trust I am not sure that AVG is what I want to use I have heard about people having problems with AVG or with them not being as effective as they had thought AVG would be 

    I like the sound of Bitdefender but I had never heard of them before coming to this page That does not mean they are not worth the time It just means that I need to expand my horizons and learn a bit about virus protection before I buy any antivirus programs I have to say this is a great place for me to start doing that I love comparisons that I do not have to do the legwork on There are quite a few programs here that I never even actually heard of so that obviously does not mean anything 

    To be honest I would rather buy a program based on a comparison like this one than to just go buy one because it has the most advertisements I want to spend my money on something that works not that has great ads

    If theres anything the recent release of Windows 8 has to show for itself its in the fact that Microsoft is stepping up its game in the security department by bundling their own inhouse antivirus and firewall product colloquially referred to as Windows Defender This tool does seem to get the job done on a more rudimentary level but if you are looking for something more comprehensive and less tied to the Microsoft brand alternatives do exist Today Ill be looking at a product thats been on the security front for quite a while now and is back better than ever in an all new release 

    Check Point Software Technologies Ltds ZoneAlarm product line is a robust alternative to solutions from the likes of Microsoft Symantec and McAfee The company has recently introduced a newcomer that is bound to bolster their options for consumers and businesses with the inclusion of a free Antivirus and Firewall edition of ZoneAlarm 

    Although ZoneAlarm has had solid success with the firewall component over the years the antivirus part is rather new and has yet to be put under some rigorous testing For reference the free version of the software updates antivirus definitions every 24 hours unlike the paid version which performs updates every hour Thats part of the cost of going free 

    As far as installation goes I was pretty satisfied with how clean and easy the installer was At the first screen as is the case with most freeware applications the installer asks if you are interested in some common bloatware toolbars Thankfully the free offers provided within were set as optin features requiring you to check the boxes before proceeding Personally I chose the Skip all offers link which is seen on the bottom lefthand corner of the install window In the next window this is where the choices got a bit more interesting 

    The first half of the selections representing installation size was fairly straightforward allowing you to save disk space now or install everything at once The second set of options sets how the application control mode should work AUTOLEARN basically means that ZoneAlarm will adapt to your web surfing and software usage while tweaking the security on the fly whereas the MAX SECURITY setting means that ZoneAlarm will effectively go on high alert and you are left to tone the restrictions down on firewall and software access as necessary Suffice to say I chose the full install and AUTOLEARN options for the purposes of this review 

    Getting to the antivirus contained within I ran a few scan tests after performing a manual definitions update Unfortunately this is where things start to slip a bit in the quality of experience department Speeds for updating and scans were quite slow and I felt that my PC started to chug a bit The scans did seem thorough enough being able to pick up some test malware and keygen executables I scattered about at random Basically for a first stab at an antivirus product by Check Point it was not a bad experience but I do believe that underlying engine optimizations are in order Hopefully by next release the speed concerns will be ameliorated for the most part because ZoneAlarm does stand a chance against the competition should they continue to blaze the trail on this productline 

    On a final note ZoneAlarm does come bundled with identity protection and an interesting feature called Advanced Download Protection download screener for your web browser which I tested in Internet Explorer 10 Heck you even get 5GB of free online storage for backup purposes Compared to other freebie security suites I will admit that the ZoneAlarm advantage is in completeness of features You almost get an entire package deal sans 247 customer support and less frequent product updates at zero cost A PC tune up tool is said to come with the paid version of ZoneAlarm Honestly though CCleaner does the job just as well for free 

    If ZoneAlarm can improve upon scanning speeds and resource consumption I would definitely use this as my goto allinone security suite for Windows However if anyone tried the software now depending on their system specifications they might be in for some disappointment and it would probably be best to at least wait until version 2014 hits the web at the end of the year

    What is the best free antivirus This is among the most common questions we receive at MakeUseOf People want to be protected but they dont want to have to pay a yearly fee or use bloated security suites with unwanted features I myself am a free antivirus user for these very reasons 

    Discovering the best antivirus isnt easy however There are a lot of points to consider including the user interface resource and overall effectiveness against the baddies Lets take an indepth look at five popular choices Avast AVG AdAware Avira and Microsoft Security Essentials to see which is best 

    Our performance testing in this article consisted of a selected scan of a single 500GB mechanical hard drive that was approximately halffull We used the full scan option Our gauge of memory usage is based off the memory the software uses while running in the background and is the rounded average of what I witnessed over three minutes of use 

    Protection information comes from AVComparatives and AVTest two leading sources for information about antivirus effectiveness The specific studies referenced are AVComparatives March 2012 Detection Test and AVTests June 2012 roundup 

    Lavasofts rather wide main menu does a good job of providing information without overwhelming the user Most of the features are turned on or off using sliders and the big bright Scan Now button makes it immediately clear where a user needs to click to perform a scan 

    Lavasoft tries to lure users in by displaying advanced features that cant be used until the full version is activated Its a bit disappointing to find a feature is not available but this approach is less bothersome than the sidebar ads used by AVG 

    Performance didnt prove to be a strong point A full scan took a tad over twenty minutes the secondlongest result The background application consumed about 32 megabytes of RAM while idle Thats not enough to drag down most systems but it is by far the worst result among the software evaluated here 

    AVComparatives still does not include Lavasoft products in its file detection tests AVTest does test it however and found that it was able to handle 99 of recently discovered threats during the most recent roundup The only flaw is 0day attacks Lavasoft detected just 80 of those threats which ties Microsoft Security Essentials for last place 

    Avast features an interface that appears smooth and modern relative to most competitors Its large window includes a lot of free white space and provides all the information you need to know about your computers current protection 

    I really like the softwares realtime shield menu It lumps all of the different threat vectors which Avast protects against into one menu and shows you how much of each have been scanned It even updates in realtime as new potential threats are checked 

Advertising is included but is mostly restricted to the installation process and the main menu The computer scan and realtime shield menus which users will deal with most frequently are devoid of ads    The interface of AVG is simple It provides a list of icons each representing a form of protection and places the scan functions to the sidebar The Scan Now link is literal Click on it and AVG will starts to work on your entire computer without any additional prompts 

    While the basic antivirus features are easy to use the additional components are a bit bewildering AVG includes everything from email protection to rootkit protection A lot of these components are handicapped however and direct you to buy one of AVGs paid solutions Other icons direct users to AVG products on other platforms like Android 

    AVG posted the least impressive scan time result It required almost 23 minutes to chew through our 500GB test drive  about 75 longer than the quickest competitor The background process however was the second smallest It consumed just 24 megabytes of RAM at idle 

    AVComparatives last file detection test found that AVG missed about 35 of all threats thrown at it one of the least impressive scores in the test group AVTest however found that the software detected 99 or recent threats in its last roundup 

    Avira has a confusing interface For example performing a specific scan requires that the user go to the System Scanner menu then click on an option then click a very small magnifying glass icon Alternatively you can click the gear button on the main menu but this opens up another menu that declares you must be in expert mode to change settings Uh what is expert mode The big fat Scan button used by competitors is more intuitive 

    Inapp advertising was light but I was hit by a popup advertisement immediately after installing the software Popup ads on my desktop are extremely annoying and not something I want to see ever There are also many features which are visible but disabled until you buy the full version 

    Avira blew away the competition in our performance tests It required just over 13 minutes to perform a full hard drive scan and its background process consumed a measly 18 megabytes of RAM at idle This software is clearly the best for users who prefer protection that is light on system resources 

    Avira did extremely well in the last AVComparatives file detection test It missed less than 5 of all samples and scored secondbest overall beating all other free solutions tested Avira also detected 99 of recently discovered threats in the last AVTest roundup 

    Microsoft Security Essentials is different from the competitors because its not a marketing tool All the other vendors offer their free antivirus in an attempt to earn name recognition and impress users but Microsoft has no paid antivirus to sell This makes for a clean interface thats not cluttered by advertisements 

    Some of the cleanliness is due to a lack of features however MSE can scan for detect quarantine and attempt to remove a virus but thats all it does Theres no mobile version no email protection no bundled antiphishing It is as the name implies only the essentials 

    Early testing of MSE suggested it was surprisingly competent but more recent tests have been less kind MSE came in last during the most recent AVComparatives file detection test It missed almost 7 of all samples AVTest found that it missed 5 of recently detected samples in its last roundup 

    Avira is the technical standout It has posted excellent scores in recent protection tests and it also ran away from the competition in our performance metrics The downside is a confusing user interface I had to explore the software for a few minutes before I understood how to operate it If Avira could make the software just at tad more intuitive it would have the perfect product 

    Avast may be a better option for users who want to fuss with protection as little as possible It is nearly as good as Avira in our performance benchmarks and it offers a slick simple interface Advertising is kept to a minimum as well 

    Lavasoft and AVG are suitable choices but both have a catch that may be significant for some users Lavasoft uses far more resources than the competitors while running in the background and AVG has an unattractive interface loaded with advertisements for the full version and other AVG products Both offer competent protection however 

    Last and least is Microsoft Security Essentials It was not the slowest in our tests nor did it eat the most RAM but protection studies have shown it to be the least effective at stopping threats by a large margin Missing 5 of recent threats in the AVTest roundup doesnt sound like much but all other competitors missed 2 or less Going with MSE makes you substantially more vulnerable 

    I am currently using a trial version but to purchase it is about 5500 for 3 computers for 3 years
I am interested in finding a system that provides Full Protection antivirus antimalware adware spyware or anything else that could pose a threat to our computers for our nonprofit 

    Yesterday I ran a virus check and using Microsoft Security Essentials AVG Advanced System Care and Advast anti virus programs separately Nothing came up until I tried Emsisoft Antivirus Guess what showed up 

    After they were removed I removed Java completely from the system using Revo Uninstaller Pro Come to find out you really dont need Java in your system All Virus scans were ran in Safe mode with networking

    Avira Free Antivirus has consistently ranked among the best free antivirus tools for Microsoft Windows in the recent years sharing this distinction with avast AVG and more recently Panda Cloud Developed by Avira Operations GmbH  Co KG based in Germany Avira Free Antivirus underwent a major update in 2008 that increased its scanning speed by 20 percent This antivirus tool has always ranked high in terms of infection detection rates since its overhaul in 2008 Avira Free Antivirus has both onaccess and ondemand scanning live updates and tech support even though it is free It also has email security and Web scanning which is a feature that most other tools offer only in paid premium versions 

    Avira Free Antivirus is ideal for high risk users Its onaccess scanning feature is constantly on the lookout for potential threats to your computer It has a fast scanning time which can be convenient if you are the type of user who conducts regular PC maintenance Its comparatively high detection rate also means that it can detect even the sneakiest bug on your PC A high detection rate however does not mean that the Avira Free Antivirus is infallible This tool has been known to miss a few adware and tracking cookies here and there Avira was embroiled in a controversy in the past as some sectors accused it of using scareware tactics to influence the purchase of its product and was likewise called out for too much advertising 

    The world of security software is diverse enough to offer people multiple options and alternatives Whereas the average commercial antivirus application provides notably high protection level it might not be affordable for some This is why free antivirus software has always had its relevance delivering the basic malware defense at no cost Of course efficiency of such programs might leave much to be desired still having one installed on your computer is way better than being completely unprotected 

    The advantages and drawbacks of free antivirus software have been a matter of numerous discussions in the IT community Some of the generally accepted virtues include pretty solid although not likely 100 virus detection scores low consumption of system resources and certainly the price equaling zero The other side of the coin encompasses some weak points which might be as follows limited protection against cyber threats poor capability to intercept zeroday infections restricted feature set and low to moderate URL sandboxing integrated And yet due to the fact that this kind of software is free it really did gain significant popularity with many users worldwide and keeps its firm positions on the security arena 

    Some of these utilities have upgrade options which means if you like the effectiveness and the rest of their traits you can get yourself a licensed counterpart to reinforce protection and get access to a much broader list of features One thing to keep in mind is that free antivirus software shouldnt be confused with the apps offering a certain trial period which is clearly stated once you begin using them Once this time interval expires youll be required to purchase the license key 

    Avast promises proactive protection from online threats including viruses spyware and rootkits while guarding traditional Internet disk media and nontraditional network and P2PIM traffic infection vectors 

    Avasts install begins with downloading a download manager which pulls the install files from a server After download the install is painless and takes less than ten clicks and three minutes to complete A restart is required to complete installation Most other antivirus suites did not require a restart but Avast has some very lowlevel components builtin which may require the restart Either way not a big deal 

    Registration is required to use Avast beyond the 60day trial period Registering grants users a 14month license key after which users must register the software again to keep using it This is a con compared to Aviras and AVGs free antivirus which do not require registration 

    Avasts interface is very unique in several ways It is entirely icondriven which means a certain learning curve However Avast is quicker to navigate than most antivirus programs once youre familiar with the interface It is also unique because the interface is very small most antivirus program interfaces are several times its size 

    Avast is generally easy to navigate The three icons on the right select which areas to scan hard disks external media additional folders and pressing the play button on the far left starts the selected scan The three buttons on the left from top to bottom open the virus chest set the onaccess scanner sensitivity and launch a manual update Updates are performed automatically every 24 hours 

    Clicking on the up arrow in the top left launches the settings menu Advanced settings and other miscellaneous items can be accessed here Avast allows users to change skins the version at the right was included with the install A nice touch though changing skins means relearning what all the icons stand for 

    Avast blocked all four test files from downloading most antivirus applications let malware download and only detect later once theyre on your PC Avast ties the expensive Kaspersky antivirus suite as the most proactive software we have tested since it detected all four files immediately Very impressive 

    Avast took up about 12 MB of system memory which is about a third of what AVG requires 35 MB a little more than half what Avira needs 20 MB and three times what Microsoft Security Essentials uses 4 MB That said even 35 MB is practically nothing by modern memory standards Firefox will often take up 100 MB all by itself 

    Avast took 34 minutes to scan our computers hard drive with 122GB of data this is a short time and faster than most paid solutions It bests Aviras 45 minutes but doesnt quite catch AVG at 23 minutes Note that this is using the default scan settings there are more indepth scanning options available 

    Avast is one of the most impressive antivirus solutions we tested even including the paid software It is extremely proactive provides many layers of protection is easy to use after learning the icondriven interface and has virtually no impact on system performance We highly recommend it to home users searching for an antivirus solution with the abovedescribed features 

    It seems like you cant go a week without one security firm or another producing a statistic illustrating just how much Android malware there is in the wilds of the internet More often than not these reports come with a few reminders that the companys own security suite can protect you from these nasty bits of code which is true some of the time However Android is by its very nature more secure than a desktop computer so maybe you dont need these security apps Youve probably already got what you need 

    The most recent Android malware report comes from Symantec which says 17 of all Android apps are malware Shocking and upsetting right This is being widely reported as 1 in 5 Android apps are malware These headlines certainly make it seem like your phone is ripe for infection but the real numbers are much more nuanced 

    As is common with these reports Symantec is sampling the entirety of the Android application ecosystem That means apps that are hosted in the Google Play Store and those that live outside it in alternative app markets and direct download sites Its not clear from the report but Id bet warezpirated APKs make it into the data as well The odds that youll come across these apps in your journeys are slim 

    Symantec has confirmed that only a very small fraction of malware apps are ever spotted in the Play Store and they are quickly pulled Google has an automated system that scans incoming apps in the Play Store to watch for malicious behavior Theres also a human review process in place for anything that looks even a little bit questionable Google just started doing this a few months ago mainly as a way to keep copycat apps and obvious scams from slipping through the cracks 

    Weve all been programmed by PC malware which can sneak onto your system simply because you visited the wrong website with a vulnerable browser These driveby downloads arent feasible on Android without a preexisting infection On Android you have to physically tap on a notification to install an APK downloaded from a source outside the Play Store Even then there are security settings that need to be manually bypassed 

    The solution pushed by AV companies is to install a security suite that manually scans every app monitors your Web traffic and so on These apps tend to be a drain on resources and are generally annoying with plentiful notifications and pop ups You probably dont need to install Lookout AVG SymantecNorton or any of the other AV apps on Android Instead there are some completely reasonable steps you can take that wont drag down your phone 

    Your first line of defense is to simply not mess around with Androids default security settings To get Google certification each and every phone and tablet comes with Unknown sources disabled in the security settings If you want to sideload an APK downloaded from outside Google Play all you need to do is check that box Leaving this disabled keeps you safe from virtually all Android malware because theres almost none of it in the Play Store 

    There are legitimate reasons to allow unknown sources though For example Amazons Appstore client sideloads the apps and games you buy and many reputable sites rehost official app updates that are rolling out in stages so you dont have to wait your turn If you do take advantage of this feature the first time you do so a box will pop up asking you to allow Google to scan for malicious activity This is known as Verify Apps and its part of Google Play Services on virtually all official Android phones 

    Users have been rooting their Android phones ever since the first handsets hit the market but its less common these days as the platform offers many of the features people used to root in order to acquire Using rooted Android is basically like running a computer in administrator mode While its possible to run a rooted phone safely its definitely a security risk Some exploits and malware needs root access to function and otherwise its harmless even if you do somehow install it If you dont have a good reason to root your phone or tablet just dont open yourself up to that possibility 

    Android apps also exist that might not be malware per se but you might not want them on your phone because they snoop through your data Most people dont read the permissions for the apps they install but the Play Store does make all that information available If youre worried about privacy check apps to see if they request things like access to your contacts SMS sendingreceiving and fine location If an app has reason to access these modules like a social networking app youre probably fine If however a flashlight app is asking for your contact list you might want to think again 

    It really just takes a tiny bit of common sense to avoid Android malware If you do nothing else keeping your downloads limited to the Play Store and other 100 trustworthy sources will keep you safe from almost all threats out there The antivirus apps are at best redundant and at worst a detriment to your system performance 

    
Most users do not think of security ie passwords written on sticky notes on monitors and  or desk drawers username and password the same noncomplex passwords no encryption when using POP3 or IMAP email protocols not keeping up with security updates for the OS they use text messaging passwords no password set for their user account on their computer etc 

    For a map program accessing the GPS or a recording program accessing the microphone most users wont mind However every single program asking for manual allowing of permissions That would annoy the users 

    
I was not sure if you meant only the first time I thought you possibly meant that the user can allow permissions when they open an application each time which would be the more secure way of doing things even though it would be annoying 

    I assume that your Android phone asks you to allow permissions everytime you run a program that needs specific permissions since you said And yet on Android and iPhone specific permissions are requested and granted at the time they are needed  

    You may be running a different version of Android than I am or I am not using applications that make use of the ask everytime for permissions OS functionality since I have never had Android ask for permissions everytime I start an application that needed specific permissions except for a GPSenabled one 

With all due respect please stay respectful There is no need to be rude in a public comments section on a public website I made a mistake on what you meant but there is no reason to be disrespectful    Just using Linux does not make your phone secure Users need to use wise judgment when installing apps either from or not from the Google Play store For example if a notepad like application wants to know your location you should be suspicious of that application 

    Unfortunately its not limited to just this category of apps Many apps on both Android and iOS have access to a scary amount of information Apple and Google have built massive spyware markets on these smartphone platforms 

    Youre installing apps on a device that is built around you making personal calls texts and GPS driving directions Some of the apps directly involve themselves in enhancing modifying or monitoring those features so of course their permission requests are going to look scary if you dont realize that No one has ever been truly anonymous on the internet if youre afraid of sharing the deep dark personal secrets about yourself with faceless corporations than you should probably stick to flip phones 

    In order to monitor a lot of the settings that these malware apps go after the security apps need some of the same permissions Some of them upload unknown apps to their servers so they can review them as well You cant really be secure without giving the security companies enough information to do what they need to 

    
The state of malware in Android is very much in flux and is very young compared to desktop threats The state of security is rapidly evolving as do the threats Since a lot of the malware out there is just repackaged legit apps it can be difficult to stay protected since a handful of malware has actually shown up in the official Market 

    Im fully aware of how the security model works in Android and why in some cases apps require certain permissions Im saying that generally speaking the market is full of apps that have access to permissions they dont need to provide their functionality The antivirus apps are one of these categories These apps have more access to information than some of the malware they remove on the mobile devices and their comparable desktop computing products 

    Most apps that are just malware detection will fail in todays market Most of them need to provide diagnostic capabilities as well To hash all your installed apps and ask a server somewhere if that particular SHA1 is malware wouldnt do very well as a realistic product 

    I guess you havent been paying much attention to the news lately The legitimate Android Marketplace does NO checking for malicious apps Thats right none at all
Downloading from that source will NOT protect you from malware And simply hoping that some conscientious user flags malware for you within a couple days is pretty chancy Face it Google dropped the ball on this issue big time 

    I didnt like Apples rigid app store approval process but this sort of thing has made me reconsider One thing you dont get with that model is viruses I dont want to run AV software on my phone period In a way one could regard a phone that is vulnerable to viruses as defective 

    One could argue that poorly Is your body defective for being vulnerable to disease Is your car defective for being vulnerable to flying rocks cracking its windshield My PC is vulnerable to viruses too but it sure as heck isnt defective And like with a PC if youre not a complete idiot you can easily avoid malware and viruses on your droid Only thing you need to ask yourself is if you feel safe and smart enough to handle decision making on your own or if you want a company to hold your hand for you and offer only their Apple approved selection of apps 

    Your comparisons fall into the straw man category and therefore do not support your argument
You also just compared a PC to a phone This is in fact exactly the problem I will tolerate AV software on my computer because I desire the flexibility to run whatever software I want but on a phone being a consumer electronic device which a desktop computer is not the use cases are quite different The vast majority of people just want it to work and reboots and crashes and viruses should be extreme rarities I bet you would consider a stereo that was vulnerable to viruses defective granted you cant install software Yes one has to put up with Apples approval process but on the other hand you get more of a phone and less of a computer It sounds like the latter is more of what you prefer and then Android is definitely more your thing 

    If anything is a straw man comparison its the stereo example You yourself admit stereos dont have software so for a stereo to be vulnerable to viruses is an impossibility For the sake of argument lets say stereos did use software and could be used to connect to the internet for downloading 3rd party programs I would expect it and ANY device with such functionality to be vulnerable to malware and viruses so no they wouldnt be defective Theres nothing in the hardware of an iPhone or Mac protecting it from viruses Viruses and Malware for Macs do exist Only thing protecting iPhone is Apples own vigilant hand denying apps from entering their store as they see fit Theres nothing defective about iPhones nothing defective about Droids and nothing defective about stereos in regards to viruses 

    Which is why youre not in Apples target demographic of those who want a phone not a computer This is OK if you actually want a handheld computer that also makes phone calls Most people want a phone that also does other things but not a handheld computer 

    Resisting the urge to try to correct the other misunderstandings in this exchange and instead focus on the core point youre looking at this whole thing from a technical perspective and not from that of the 99 of the population that doesnt read ExtremeTech Its easy for people like us to make statements like dont grant access to apps youre unsure about because we understand the technology Think about all those you know who dont understand it From their perspective a phone with a virus is defective and the important thing for us to understand is that they are correct Too much software is written assuming a technical user because thats the way we think when the real users are seldom technical at all 

    The whole Consumer Electronic Device is bollocks An easy way of trying to justify the fact that you cant do as much as you can with a phone as you can with a computer once they lock down the devices to prevent piracy Make no mistake your iPhone and Android Phone are both ARM IS PCs with a SIM based wireless NIC bolted on 

    I think youll find the vast majority of smartphones these days are closer to miniture computers than phones So hes not part of the problem at all The major part of the problem with these things is exactly the same as it was before Dumb people doing dumb things with their toys I dont run a virus scanner on my pc or my mobile This is because i dont go clicking on everything that says YOU HAVE A VIRUS CLICK THIS TO INSTALL CLEANER  If i find dodgy processes on my PC i work out how to get rid of them On the RARE occasion ive had something wrong theres generally something about to clean it that gets removed once its done its job 

    This test must have been done quite a bit in the past When I go to marketandroidcom and search for Antivirus and then sort only free by popularity there are three apps higher on the list than the Antivirus Free that the report lists as being the most popular by far 

    Lookout Security  Antivirus is one of those listed as more popular with 10mil to 50mil installs It is also one of the most talked about security apps for Android that Ive seen in the many blogs and sites I follow I cant help but wonder why it was excluded from the list 

    Cyanogenmod has implemented a great feature other custom ROMs might as well where you can individually revoke permissions from apps This can lead to the program force closing if you take away to many permissions but I have been able to modify most of the permissions from those few apps that seemed a little iffy to me Google needs to have this built into the OS because I think it is one of the most effective ways to stop all this malware and spyware 

    Antivirus programs have long held a place of importance on the desktop but as mobile operating systems have grown in popularity the desktop security dogma has bled overThats not desktop dogma thats Windows dogma My desktop has been Linux for a dozen years and SunOS Solaris for the previous 10 Ive never needed or wanted an antivirus solution 

    Antivirus programs have long held a place of importance on the desktop but as mobile operating systems have grown in popularity the desktop security dogma has bled overNo this is Microsoft Windows dogma My desktop has been Linux for a dozen years and SunOS  Solaris for the preceding decade Ive never needed or wanted antivirus software I imagine that MacOS X experience is similar Antivirus software was useful for earlier MacOS versions 

    To be fair Linux esp 5 years ago and before that was but a blip in the desktop PC market Mac OS recently got a virus that masqueraded as a legit security app called MAC defender  Tell me again how theyre secure  Im POSITIVE that someone somewhere would find a way to infect peoples Linux machines IF they owned a significant portion of the market Evidence Androids infection   its Linuxbased isnt it Huh guess Linux can get infected 

    So basically you dont need it because no one gives a shit about your OS Youre not worth it I myself use Windows and also do not rely on any antiwhatever Why Because its obvious when something is a virus I dont need a program to tell me that downloading something from getyourvirusesandmalwareherecom is going to screw up my PC I dont blindly download anything  I read about it first make sure its legit read the comments google it etc Only a fool relies on a program to do their thinking regardless of their OS 

    Based on your logic there would NEVER be a security update for either package or kernel in Linux Those who actually use it know that no security is perfect and professional users are always evaluating risk and working to minimize it That can mean running AVeven on linux 

    I think i might be able to define whats the difference in between them computer virus is a program or piece of code that is loaded onto your computer without your knowledge and runs against your wishes All computer viruses are manmade and they can also replicate themselves by making a copy of themselves over and over again 

     i hope this might clear the lil bit of fog between these two and in my last comment i told you guys about Appriva antivirus which also is anti spyware one of its a anti spyware feature which is like the most is i m able to know how good is my privacy compared to others 

    This article is complete contradictory referencing zoner antivirus The permissions that are required are
StorageModifydelete contents

SERVICES THAT COST YOU MONEY DIRECTLY CALL PHONE NUMBERS SEND SMS MESSAGES WTF

    I didnt like Apples rigid app store approval process but this sort of thing has made me reconsider One thing you dont get with that model is viruses I dont want to run AV software on my phone period In a way one could regard a phone that is vulnerable to viruses as defective  

    While bad apps do occasionally show up in the Market Google removes them swiftly and can remotely kill the apps on phonesAm I the only idiot who didnt know Google can reach into my phone and do whatever it feels like doing without my permission Cause Im pretty sure I didnt sign up for this security feature

    I have a new nexus 4 android My son is telling me I may have a virus on my brand new phone cause it keeps freezing and sometimes when I open a app it opens black then freezes The phone is only 15 months old does anyone have any suggestions as to what this could be Thank you for any help that u can give  

I had some trouble on my Galaxy TAB 2  maybe because of a malware but someone said that the best I can do is to do a clean install or factory reset
    I was also facing same issue I tried a lot to fix this however I was not able to do that At last I just visited  and made a call on their toll free I got instant help for my computer by a certified technician 

    If you get DVasive you will be given an alert when another app tries to spy on you If your CAMERA MIC WIFI or BLUETOOTH are turned on by another app you will be given a notification You can also lock each of these devices down so another app cannot possibly turn on your CAMERA MIC BLUETOOTH or WIFI Its that simple
